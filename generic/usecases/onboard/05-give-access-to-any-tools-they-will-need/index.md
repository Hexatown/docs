Before your employee arrives, it is important to __prepare the necessary tools__ and ensure your new hire will be able to access them\. __Fill in \(or add to\)__ the __form fields__ below as necessary\.

__Wifi Password__

__Email List of Co\-Workers__

__Department Phone Numbers__

Also consider details like \(but not limited to\):

- Keys to rooms they will need access to
- Company mobile phone

To make sure you provide your employee with all the necessary items, you can __note down the steps you take__each day and what tools you use\. You can also __make a checklist__ here on [Process Street](https://www.process.st/) that you can also use in future when distributing tools to new employees __ensuring you remember everything__\.

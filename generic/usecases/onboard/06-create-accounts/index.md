No self\-respecting employee onboarding checklist would be complete without making sure that you __create all the accounts required by the new employee__\.__ Fill in \(or add to\)__ the__ form fields__ below as necessary\.

__Employee Company Email__

__Employee Username \(first initial, last name e\.g\. bbrandall\)__

__Employee Company Phone Line__

__Employee Company Social Accounts__

As shown above, create accounts on all __social platforms your company uses__\. Your employee should have their own __email and phone line__\. If your company uses apps like [Slack](https://slack.com/) or [Trello](https://trello.com/) you should create an account there as well\.

Often a new employee will arrive during a busy working week\. In this case welcoming the new hire is overlooked and they are not __caught up to speed with the team or new role__\. To avoid this, you should __clear your schedule__ and make the new employee the __number one priority__ for the day\.

You should __introduce them to the team__ \- talk about their role, tell them why you selected them \- this will help the rest of the __team remember them__ better\. Notify your team in advance that the new employee is arriving so they can__ schedule some time to get to know them__\.

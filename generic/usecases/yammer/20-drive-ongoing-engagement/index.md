Once a group is up and running, keep the momentum going\.

Here are a few recommendations for Group Owners:

- Ask questions\.
- Tag an expert to draw their opinion or insight into a conversation\.
- Share relevant conversations in the network with the group\.
- Post weekly roundups or related content to the group\.
- Praise group members for things you'd like to see other group members do\.
- Make sure all of your group posts are answered\. @mention someone if a question comes up you're not sure how to answer\.
- Add relevant content – upload files and notes to add context to conversations\.
- Use Announcements for important updates that need to reach the entire group\.
- Connect with others launching Yammer and grow your network of community managers through the [Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/)\.

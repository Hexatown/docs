After your network is up and running, measure success to understand your groups' engagement and activity, and inform your efforts to improve, grow, or execute campaigns in your groups\.

__Measure and grow engagement with Group Insights__

Gain insights on how people are using Yammer in your organization, with reporting capabilities that provide an extensive view into Yammer usage and adoption at the user, device, and group levels:

3. [Microsoft Graph reporting APIs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph)

Anyone within a group can view group insights by selecting __View Group Insights__\.

From the __Group Insights__ drop\-down, you can select to view activity for the last 7 days, 28 days, or 12 months\.

This helps you:

- Know how many members and non\-members are active in the group
- Observe predominant activity \- posting, reading, or liking messages \- of group members and non\-members
- Get a glimpse of how key metrics \- for example, number of active people, number of posted messages \- have changed since the previous period

Group insights also show you how activities are trending over time\. The visualized trends show the contributions to activity of the group, to help you track engagement with content from campaigns or initiatives hosted on Yammer, report back to leaders, and optimize efforts\.

One of the first thing we have identified in the knowledge network established with the Financial Sector in Denmark, check [hexatown](http://www.hexatown.com), is the need for a general blue print / overview of Offic365 stack and the compliance state of the individual services. Inspired by the Infgoraphics developed by [Matt Wade](http://icansharepoint.com/) we have developed an interactive version of the ["Office 365 Periodic Table"](http://365admin.net/docs/office365/).

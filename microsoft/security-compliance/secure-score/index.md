Secure Score is a security analytics tool that will help you understand what you have done to reduce the risk to your data in Office 365, and show you what you can do to further reduce that risk. We think of it as a credit score for security

## Your Secure Score

Secure Score figures out what Office 365 services you are using, then looks at your configuration and behaviors and compares it to a baseline asserted by Microsoft. If your configuration and behaviors are in line with best practices, you will get points, which you can track over time. More importantly, you will be able to quick determine what things you can do to reduce their risk

## Take Action, Improve Your Score

Secure Score helps you quickly figure out what actions you can take to improve your score. You can check your action queue and find the change you can make that most improves your security posture with the least amount of usability impact for your users

## Analyzing Your Score

Secure Score gives you a different way of managing your risk. Rather than reacting or responding to security alerts, the Secure Score lets you track and plan incremental improvements over a longer period of time

## DISCLAIMER

The Secure Score does not express an absolute measure of how likely you are to get breached. It expresses the extent to which you have adopted controls which can offset the risk of being breached. No service can guarantee that you will not be breached, and the Secure Score should not be interpreted as a guarantee in any way

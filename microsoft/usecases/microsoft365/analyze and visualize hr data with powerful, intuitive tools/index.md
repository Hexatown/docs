Quickly import and analyze your data with powerful data analysis tools, and create beautiful reports that you share in interactive dashboards.


## Import and clean up your data like a pro

Sometimes HR information systems don’t give you the exact report you need, or you might want to combine employee data from two different systems. **Excel** can bridge this gap for you. First, use Get & Transform in Excel to import a file or connect to the data source, and then “shape” the data (for example, remove a column, change a data type, or merge tables) to meet your needs. You’ll end up with a nicely formatted data table from which to summarize, filter, and visualize your data and find new insights.

## Get quick insights by filtering and formatting your data

After your data is in front of you, you need to display it in a meaningful way. With **Excel**, you have plenty of options. Conditional formatting lets you apply colors to cells based on specified criteria. Filters let you temporarily hide some of your data. The Total Row option automatically sums your data.

## Gain new insights by looking at your data from different angles

It can be hard to see comparisons, patterns, or trends when you have a lot of data to analyze. For example, how do you analyze salary information by department, region, and tenure when you have data for thousands of employees? Use PivotTables in **Excel** to quickly summarize your data and discover hidden insights. When your data is organized in a list or a table, you can easily use a Recommended PivotTable, or create your own PivotTable. You can also create a PivotChart to visualize data for additional insights.

## Present data in a compelling way for better decision-making

After you've gathered and analyzed your data, it's time to share your insights. With **Power BI**, you can easily pull your results from Excel into an interactive online dashboard that can be shared with your team. For example, you can share an always-up-to-date overview of new hire stats, or a trend analysis of employee engagement survey results.

## Easily find and retrieve data from a large dataset

When you need to find information in a large spreadsheet, or if you're always looking for the same type of information, use the VLOOKUP function in **Excel**. VLOOKUP is one of several lookup and reference functions included in Excel to make it easy to find and work with your data. Start with a piece of data you know (a name or employee number) to find the data you don't know (the job title, department, manager, HR contact, or start date).

## Share best practices and tips with other sales associates in a single location

To best serve your customers, you need to be able to share sales tips, information, and best practices with your colleagues, and you need to be sure that the information you're sharing is accurate and up to date. By storing notes and documentation in a **SharePoint** team site, you can be sure that you are working with the latest files, in an environment protected with enterprise-grade security. SharePoint provides your team with a single, integrated workspace that uses both versioning and access control, and because it is fully integrated with **Office 365** desktop and mobile apps, you can store, share, and work with your files any time, from anywhere.

## Exchange information in open discussions with your team in real time

You and your sales colleagues can easily discuss tips, issues, and best practices, without losing any time on the floor, by having conversations in a dedicated **Yammer** group. A Yammer group is a portal for sharing and collecting ideas from each team member, giving everyone a chance to weigh in. Because Yammer is integrated with **Office Groups**, members of your group are immediately connected with a set of shared resources via the **SharePoint** document library. Your team can also set up a **OneNote** notebook to share tips and best practices, all from within Yammer.

## Access a virtual expert network for sales guidance and best practices

When you need to extend your reach to tap into the experience of the sales experts in your company, you can post a question to another **Yammer** group to bring them into the conversation. Yammer gives your experts the access they need, even from mobile devices and smartphones. To find answers from experts outside your company, you can use a Yammer external group to open up the conversation while keeping your internal information and documents private.

## Quickly gain consensus on sales practices

Your manager has asked you to pull together a FAQ for the field on updated best practices, and now you need to get the sales team and managers involved in a discussion around it, to agree on next steps. To quickly bring the team together, use the IM capabilities of **Skype for Business** or **Outlook** group conversations. Skype for Business is integrated across **Office 365**, so it’s easy to take and store notes from your discussion in Word or in a OneNote digital notebook. Then you can post notes and files on a **SharePoint** team site so they’re available for future reference.

## Solicit feedback from the whole company, from anywhere

To instantly update your whole company about new sales techniques and get feedback, you can create a companywide **Yammer** group for the purpose. The Yammer enterprise social network makes it easy for you to ask questions and get feedback from everyone, wherever they are, eliminating time zone–related challenges. You can provide easy access to the files they need right from the team’s Yammer workspace. Better yet, everyone in the Yammer group has direct access from their Android, iOS, or Windows device, any time they need it.

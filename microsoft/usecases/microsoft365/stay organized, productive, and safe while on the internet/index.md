Safely find and download the data and resources you need by browsing the web with Microsoft Edge, the faster, safer browser designed for Windows 10.


## Manage open browser windows to easily find what you need

When your job requires you to work extensively on the web, it can be a nightmare to try to keep track of your open browser windows. **Microsoft Edge** makes your life easier by including a variety of intuitive tab management features, such as a tab preview bar with visual thumbnails, to help you quickly navigate multiple open windows.

## Access your personal digital assistant from your browser

When you browse the internet with **Microsoft Edge** on your Windows 10 device, **Cortana** can supply helpful and relevant information from across the web, right in the browser. Ask Cortana a question, and she instantly searches the internet or your own devices to find answersâ€”or you can track packages, get current flight information, and much more. On pages where Cortana can help, she'll show up in the address bar with suggestions. Click her message to see how she can help you.

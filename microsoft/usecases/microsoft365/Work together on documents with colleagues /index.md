## Edit the same document together

When working on a document, you can edit together with your colleagues with coauthoring in **Office 365Â **apps such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. First, you save the document to **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, so others can work in it with you in real-time. By saving the document to the cloud, you and your colleagues are all working off the same copy, and can see each other's changes as soon as they're made.

## While editing, chat with colleagues

While you're editing in the same Office document (Excel, PowerPoint, or Word), you can discuss thoughts and feedback with your team from within the Office app with **Skype for Business**. Click the Chat button to open the chat pane, and type in the box at the bottom of the pane to kick off the conversation. Everyone on your team who is working in the document will see your message and be able to respond.

## Share the draft from a central location

When you've finished the draft and are ready to seek final approval, you can post it to a shared **SharePoint** library where executives can easily access it. A SharePoint library is a location on a site where you can create, collect, update, and manage files with team members, from almost any device. Once the draft is saved to the central location, your executives can open it up for review, from any web browser, and from anywhere.

## Send out the finalized document

Once you've received approval on the document, you can ready it for circulation with your broader team. First, you can mark the document as final with **Word** to prevent further changes. When a document is marked as final, typing, editing commands, and proofing marks are disabled or turned off and the document becomes read-only.

Now you can send the final document to its itended audience using **Outlook Modern Attachments**. When you send an attachment that's saved to the cloud, you ensure everyone is viewing the same copy of the document. Recipients can access the attachment from virtually any device.

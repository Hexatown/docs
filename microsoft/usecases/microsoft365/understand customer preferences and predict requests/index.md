Know as much about customers as about the products that are sold in order to better understand and predict their preferences.


## Make customer sales data interactive

You can analyze historical store sales data to learn more about customer preferences with **Excel**. With Excel, you can create a workbook using data from multiple sources, create dynamic charts and graphs, and run Quick Analysis to identify trends.

With **Power BI**, you can take data analytics even further. Business intelligence (BI) is essentially a set of tools and processes that businesses use to gather data, turn it into meaningful information, and then make better decisions. By creating interactive Power BI dashboards, you can visualize your customer data and share information about customer preferences with people in your organization across multiple devices.

## Talk directly to customers

To learn more about customer preferences straight from the source, you can invite customers to share their feedback with your team through **Yammer**. Yammer is a private social network where businesses share information across teams, and organize around projects. Yammer now allows you to create a group that includes external users. External groups will look different than regular Yammer groups, so you can easily distinguish which groups have external participants.

## Share customer feedback across the company

With customer feedback now in tow, you can join relevant internal conversations on **Yammer** to talk about your findings. You can start a new conversation, and even loop in specific product teams with **@mentions** to alert them to the thread. External participants can only see specifically set up Yammer Groups, so your internal communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization.

## Securely access financial data from a central location

When you need to run analytics to back up a potential new business opportunity, you can make it easier to gather past and current financial data by storing all files in a central, dedicated **SharePoint** team site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Files and folders stored on the team site are automatically shared with everyone on your team. To protect sensitive financial data, you can customize SharePoint settings to broaden or limit which users can access information and what they can do to it.

## Quickly compare internal and external figures

After you've pulled your internal data from your **SharePoint** site, you can compare it with data imported from multiple external sources, including the web, by using **Excel** Power Query. A query enables you to connect to, preview, and transform data from a wide variety of available data sources, like Facebook or Salesforce, and import the data into your Excel workbook. Excel also works with **Power BI**, to provide a powerful portfolio of analytic tools. With Power BI, you have a dedicated environment for visual data exploration and report authoring.

## Confirm your findings with your company's experts

To make sure you have the full picture, you can use **Microsoft Teams**, the chat-based workspace, to quickly touch base in real time and drill down to documents and charts specific to the discussion. When you create a Teams channel, you can chat in real time about your financial data in a single, dedicated chat forum to keep all conversations in one place. Teams allows you to work together in a seamless coauthoring experience. When you need to, you can pull in field experts with @mentions. You can even launch live audio or video meetings right from Teams.

## Quickly forecast future trends

When you feel you have all your data represented, you can create one-click forecasts in **Excel** to help decide whether it's a smart idea to move forward with a new business opportunity. When you create a forecast, Excel creates a new worksheet that contains both a table of the historical and predicted values and a chart that expresses this data. A forecast can help you predict things like future sales, inventory requirements, or consumer trends.

Improve customer service among your store&apos;s sales associates and reduce complaints by allowing your sales team to securely access customer reviews and other company apps anywhere, anytime, on their devices.


## Collaborate securely and safeguard corporate and customer data

To provide the best customer service, you need to closely monitor reviews and have access to your company’s sales apps—all while protecting customer data. With centrally managed security policies in **Office 365**, you can self-install the business apps you need to answer customer questions and address issues quickly.

When you keep your data in a collaborative **SharePoint** workspace, everyone on your team can easily access all product information needed for the job. You can also safely store data on **OneDrive**, where your team collaborate only when you give express permission.

## Use single sign-on across devices and storage centers to access data

In the fast-paced retail business, you don’t always have time to access sales apps and customer data on a computer. You can work quickly from wherever you are—on the sales floor or in the field—while still ensuring that data remains secure with single sign-on access to devices and **Office** apps, provided by **Azure Active Directory**. You can securely launch all cloud-based applications from a personalized web-based access panel or mobile app by using your company credentials. Robust mobile security features, such as mobile device management (MDM), provide secure access to apps across devices.

## Create, share, or review customer data in real time from your device

Coauthoring sales documents on mobile devices is easy and secure with **Office** mobile apps. From a **SharePoint** team site, your team can create, collect, update, and manage files, from almost any device. You can easily share documents with an email invitation that provides a link to the site.

SharePoint uses powerful concepts like permission levelsand inheritance to keep information more secure, but you don’t have to understand those concepts to accomplish everyday tasks like sharing a site.

## Protect confidential information when viewing it on your device

You need to keep information such as vendor contracts, sales reports, and loss prevention documentation confidential. You can be sure that all internal documents are protected when you enroll your devices in mobile device management (MDM) or **Microsoft Intune**. Intune and built-in MDM for **Office 365** are two different ways to manage mobile devices in your organization.

And, with the Office 365  Message Encryption viewer and **Exchange** ActiveSync, you can encrypt messages and block unsupported devices from accessing sent information, further protecting your customers' and your company's data.

## Rely on managed device and app security to help prevent data leakage

Mobile device management (MDM) provides industry-leading device security, so you and your customers can feel confident that information is protected through a data loss prevention (DLP) policy (set up in the **Office 365** Security & Compliance Center) that identifies, monitors, and automatically protects sensitive information.

Taking that protection one step further, if you or someone on your sales team loses a device or leaves the company, the device can be remotely wiped clean of organizational data, either selectively or completely.

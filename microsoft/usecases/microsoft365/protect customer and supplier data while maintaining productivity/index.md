## Access customer and supplier data based on your credentials

You often need to be able to access customer orders and supply chain documents when you are away from your facility. However, your company also needs to make sure that this data is secure. Your organization can use **Azure Active Directory** (Azure AD) conditional access policies to apply access rules to any Azure AD–connected application, such as Office 365 and Salesforce.com. More-sensitive apps can be assigned stricter policies, such as requiring **Azure Multi-Factor Authentication** or even blocking access outside the corporate network. Conditional access policies are available through **Azure AD Premium**.

## Label and classify customer orders and documents based on their sensitivity

Sometimes you need to share pertinent company information outside the company to get your job done. But it can be difficult to determine which documents include too much private company information or information about other customers. With **Azure Information Protection**, your company can classify data based on sensitivity and add labels manually or automatically, encrypt your sensitive data and define usage rights when needed, apply protection easily without interrupting your team’s normal course of work, and see what’s happening with shared data to gain more control over it.

## Encrypt companywide documents and protect critical company data

When you store or send sensitive customer and company information, you must ensure that it remains secure. If your company uses Microsoft products and services such as **Office 365**, you can rely on industry-leading security and encryption to keep your data safe. Microsoft uses multiple encryption methods, protocols, and algorithms across its products and services to help provide a secure path for data to travel, and to help protect the confidentiality of stored data.

## Prevent data loss in the event of a lost or stolen device

Accidents—and theft—happen. If you or a coworker loses a device, potential information leakage can be prevented if all BYOD devices are enrolled in a data loss prevention policy, powered by **Microsoft** **Intune**. Your company can use mobile device management (MDM) for **Office 365** to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices—fully or selectively—if they’re lost or stolen.

## Work securely on different operating systems and devices

When your company is spread out—possibly across continents—you need a way to keep communications, customer orders, service reports, and other senstive documents secure across time zones, devices, and platforms and still stay productive.

**Microsoft Intune** provides security policies that protect company information in the cloud and on-premises, across almost any device and platform. When your company uses Intune with the other services in **Enterprise Mobility + Security**, you gain mobile app security over and above what is provided by the mobile operating system and the mobile apps themselves.

## Uncover existing templates

When you're beginning a new draft RFP, you can discover previous RFPs and RFP templates that might be helpful through your **Delve** network. Delve helps you discover relevant information through the power of Office Graph, which automatically populates Delve with activities you already do every day, such as which documents you share, which people you meet with, and which documents you read. Delve shows you a mix of content from across Office 365; you’ll see both your own documents, and documents your colleagues are working on. Find potentially helpful templates by searching for RFPs. Delve never changes any permissions, so you'll only see documents that you already have access to.

## Reach out to colleagues for customer insights

Leverage the expertise of your coworkers to customize the RFP with information relevant to the customer. You can identify colleagues familiar with your customer through **Yammer** Group conversations. Yammer is an enterprise social network where coworkers share information across teams, and organize around projects. When you create a new Group, you can choose to make it public and engage with coworkers across your organization, or private, to communicate just with your team.

## Quickly obtain feedback from topic experts

When you need immediate input, you can connect with available colleagues to draw on their experience with **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration in one tool. You can tell whether a colleague is available for an IM chat or call by the presence indicator next to his or her name. Green means go!

## Circulate the draft RFP for feedback

When you're happy with your draft, you can solicit feedback on your RFP from offline and external colleagues with **Outlook** Modern Attachments. With Outlook Modern Attachments, you'll see a list of recently accessed doccuments so that you can easily find and share what you've been working on. Recipients can access the attachment from virtually any device. As you're sending, choose whether to allow your colleagues edit or just read-only permission on the draft RFP. 

When you send an attachment that's saved to the cloud, such as in your **OneDrive,** you ensure everyone is viewing the same copy of the document. OneDrive gives you full control of who can access, view, and edit your files. When you share the RFP with editing permissions, you are automatically ready to coauthor. You can also use the version history feature of OneDrive to restore or review older versions of the RFP.

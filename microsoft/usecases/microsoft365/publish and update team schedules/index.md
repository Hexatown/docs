Create a shift schedule in minutes and send it directly to each worker&apos;s mobile device.


## Create employee groups for easier scheduling

As a supervisor, when you use **StaffHub** to add employees to your team, you can simplify the process of scheduling workers across multiple departments or functions by creating group schedules. (An employee can be part of more than one group if he or she works in multiple departments.)

Using named groups helps you organize your team members by role or department on the schedule. For example, a hotel might have Front Desk, Room Service, and Valet groups. In StaffHub, it's easy to group and ungroup your team members, add and remove groups, assign team members to groups, and move them between groups, to reflect the changing needs of your company.

## Create a schedule and assign workers to shifts

No more posting printed shift schedules on breakroom bulletin boards. With **StaffHub**, you can fill shifts quickly by creating a schedule on your desktop or from your mobile device. Need to notify the day's staff about a change or event? You can attach a note to the relevant worker's shift, such as "Review the new breakfast menu items" or "District manager visiting this afternoon."

Use StaffHub's color coding system to designate specific shift types (such as opening, closing, and swing shifts) or responsibilities. You can save time each week by clicking the convenient Copy Last Schedule button to quickly create next week's schedule from this week's.

## Distribute a schedule to all firstline workers

With one click in **StaffHub**, your weekly schedule goes out to every scheduled staff member. Workers receive their specific shift hours, complete with reminders and notes. Staff members can use their mobile devices to view their upcoming shifts and any related notes, see who else is working when they are, and use Calendar view for a quick glance at the hours assigned to them for the week or month.

## Manage schedule changes efficiently

**StaffHub** simplifies the process of handling schedule changes. After you publish a schedule, any changes that you make to it are immediately available to scheduled workers. Staff members can propose shift swaps among themselves and request time off, directly from their mobile devices. As the supervisor, you always have the final say. You can approve or deny the request directly in StaffHub. If you approve the request, StaffHub automatically updates the schedule.

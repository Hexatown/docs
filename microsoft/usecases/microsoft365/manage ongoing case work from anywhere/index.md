Ensure secure online and offline access to client documents, data, and discovery to keep working and put in billable hours from the office, airport, client site, or any other location.


## Work on client deliverables on the go

While away from the firm, you can create a new document or edit an existing one from your tablet or smartphone by using **OneDrive** and mobile Office apps. By storing your documents in the cloud with OneDrive, you can access it across all of your devices.

From the App Store, you can download and install Office applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote on your tablet or smartphone. Because your **Office 365** apps sync across devices, you can work on a document you started at the office from your phone.

## Mine client data and discovery

You can easily find client data and review discovery documents stored on **SharePoint**. Organizations use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.

When you search a SharePoint site, your query searches the current site and any subsites below it. When you know that the content you are looking for is contained in a specific list or library, start your search in the search box on that list or library.

## Secure partner signoff on client deliverables

When you need feedback quickly, you can pool resources with associates by simultaneously editing files using **Office 365** coauthoring capabilities. Because you're already storing your documents in the cloud with **OneDrive**, you can quickly share your file with colleagues and work together in real-time, seeing edits as they happen, while your changes are automatically synced back to the cloud.

## Share deliverables with clients

When you're happy with your document, you can easily and securely share it with your clients with **Outlook** Modern Attachments. When you send an attachment that's saved to the cloud, you ensure everyone is viewing the same copy of the document. Clients can access the attachment from virtually any device. As you're sending, choose whether to allow your clients edit or just read-only permission on the document. Â

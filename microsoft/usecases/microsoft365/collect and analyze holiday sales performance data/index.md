Accurately evaluate holiday performance by collecting, analyzing, and visualizing internal and external holiday sales trends and social media sentiment data.


## Analyze data, visualize sales trends, and generate reports quickly

Tools that quickly analyze sales trends and tap into the pulse of social media can help you and your company's other managers evaluate sales performance, so that you can develop and share insights. When you store data in **Excel**, you can use the Quick Analysis feature to instantly identify and create charts that suit the type of data you’re working with.

## Present complex holiday sales data in a visual format

You can use **Excel** to display sales performance data in a visual format for sales associates and managers. For example, you can predict future possibilities from historical time-based data by creating a Forecast Sheet, and use PowerPivot to create scorecards that use conditional formatting and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as base values, target values, and status thresholds. These and other Excel reporting features provide visual representations of data that you can share with team members to make faster, more effective business decisions.

## Expedite decision-making with easy-to-understand data charts and tables

When you have a large amount of data to analyze, you can provide insight from multiple angles by presenting it in a PivotTable or charting it in a PivotChart. By using either of these **Excel** features, you can easily surface the specific aspects of the data that you need to make decisions. You can add slicers or timeline controls to make the data accessible to team members.

## Share dashboards and reports with team members

Transfer data from Excel and other sources into **Power BI** and display it in interactive dashboards, so that sales associates and stakeholders can easily view and understand your findings. By using Power BI, you can monitor the health of your business using a live dashboard, create rich interactive reports, and access your data on the go. Because Power BI comes with a language recognition engine, you can query the data and build reports and chart by using simple phrases and questions.

Create, share, and sync classroom documents from any location to get more done while on the go.


## Take classroom tools everywhere

When you're not at school, you can access your productivity tools with **Office** mobile apps. From the **App Store**, you can download and install Office applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote on your tablet or smartphone. Because your Office 365 apps sync across devices, you can work on a lesson plan you started at school from your smartphone.

## Draft a new lesson plan on the go

While out of the office, you can create a new lesson plan from your tablet or smartphone by starting in **OneDrive**. By starting from OneDrive, your document is automatically saved to the cloud. Start a Word document, and it will open in the **Word** mobile app you already installed.

## Edit slides for an upcoming lecture

From your **OneDrive** library, open a slide deck you've used in previous years in the **PowerPoint** mobile app. You can flip through your slides and make minor updates to ensure it's ready for your lecture later in the evening. When you save it as a new presentation, make sure you still save it in OneDrive to make it available on any device.

## Conduct class virtually

When it's time for class, **Skype for Business** allows you to lead your class remotely using video, audio, instant messaging, and content sharing. You can pre-load your slide deck as a meeting attachment before joining. That way, when students join the meeting, the slides are already available for download and you can start presenting them right away.

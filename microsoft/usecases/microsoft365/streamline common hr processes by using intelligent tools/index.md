Take the repetitiveness out of onboarding new employees, reviewing employee policies, and other HR tasks by creating automated workflows and using intelligent tools.


## Easily create surveys and polls and analyze results

As an HR professional, you often want to check in with employees: How do they feel about work-life balance? How can you improve new employee onboarding? Which type of teambuilding activities do they enjoy? With **Microsoft Forms**, you can create surveys and polls, and easily see the results as they come in. Your employees can respond to your surveys by using any web browser, even on their mobile devices.

## Create custom workflows to automate routine tasks

Every time you hire a new employee, you perform the same set of steps. For example, you might add the employee’s information to an onboarding list, and then send email to various departments to initiate the onboarding process. Wouldn't it be great if your computer did this for you? You can use **Microsoft Flow** to do just that: set up a workflow from **SharePoint** to your email app, automatically sending the right emails to the right people whenever you add a new person to a SharePoint list.

## Streamline the approval process for HR workflows

Human Resources departments often route requests through several people for approval. Your team can simplify these approval processes by using **Microsoft Flow** to set up automated workflows to quickly process requests or document reviews. Flow seamlessly works with data that is stored in **SharePoint** or other apps. You can view and respond to all approval requests in a unified approvals center.

## Visualize your team's work in a simple, intuitive planning board

It can be a challenge to keep on top of your responsibilities when you're working on many different projects. Use **Microsoft Planner** to create plans, organize and assign tasks, and get updates on progress. Planner offers a simple, highly visual way to organize teamwork and give all team members visibility into who is working on what. You can attach files to tasks, work together on those files, and even have conversations around tasks. The My Tasks view provides a complete list of all of your tasks and their status across all of your projects.

## Develop apps for HR and employees, working with data you’re already using

Sometimes you need to solve a problem, but none of your current apps offers a solution. Use **Microsoft PowerApps** to easily create your own apps, all without having to write a single line of code. PowerApps lets you create and share apps that work on any device. Use pre-built templates, or start from scratch to create a health plan selector, interview tool, organization browser, suggestion box, and more.

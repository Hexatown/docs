## Create and use custom apps to track sales leads

Stay on top of active and potential leads by quickly accessing account activity logs, new lead and contact details, milestones, and account information by using custom apps. With **PowerApps**, you use intuitive tools and pre-built templates to create exactly what you need—without writing a single line of code. Check out the sample apps in PowerApps to see if the solution you're looking for is already available—such as a PowerApp that connects to your Salesforce account—or to use one as the basis for a customized app of your own.

## Quickly populate emails to send to customers

Time spent composing and sending emails to prospective customers is time that could be spent on actual selling. With **Outlook**, you can compose and save a message as a template and reuse it whenever you want. For creating a more customized message, the Outlook Quick Parts feature provides building blocks, which are reusable pieces of content or other email message parts that are stored in galleries. You can access and reuse the building blocks at any time.

Quickly sign into your company sales apps while ensuring that your company&apos;s and customer&apos;s data is secure, by using industry-leading identity management controls and secure sign-in methods.


## Access company sales apps more securely from almost any device

You can more securely access and work with your company's proprietary or third-party sales apps, such as Salesforce, even when you are out on the sales floor or in the field, when your company uses **Azure Active Directory (AD) Premium**. Azure AD Premium helps protect your company's data and apps with identity and access management in the cloud. It works with iOS, Mac OS X, Android, and Windows devices, so you can rely on its enterprise-grade security from wherever you are, on almost any device.

## Stay productive while meeting security compliance requirements

To stay connected and productive, you need to be able to use your company's sales apps to access and analyze sales and customer data without being delayed by your company's compliance policies. **Azure AD Premium** provides single sign-on to any cloud and on-premises web app, ensuring fast access to the work files and apps sales reps need while helping to protect the company's data. The robust mobility security features of **Windows 10 Enterprise** help you stay productive and secure from wherever you are.

## Manage and maintain security policies across all sales apps

The integration of the sales apps your team works with is key to your ability to quickly analyze customer data, qualify leads, and negotiate winning deals. Because **Azure AD Premium** and **Windows 10 Enterprise** are fully integrated, Azure AD's robust security umbrella covers all of the apps you work with and rely on, such as **Dynamics CRM**. And all **Office 365** apps, including familiar productivity apps such as Excel and PowerPoint, and new enterprise social networking apps such as Yammer, fall under this umbrella, providing peace of mind as you work your leads and stay productive.

## Use highly secure and advanced sign-in methods to protect sales apps and data

Secure, convenient sign-in has been a necessity since people started communicating across the internet. By using **Windows Hello**, you can sign in to your devices, apps, online services, and networks by using facial, iris, or fingerprint recognition, making it easy for you to stay productive while helping to ensure that the company's data stays secure. **Credential Guard**, an integrated part of **Windows 10 Enterprise**, uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them.

## Make sure your sales apps meet all your compliance requirements

As important as it is to maintain easy access to the data and apps you need to be successful, protecting your company from security compliance violations is key to retaining customer trust and maintaining your organization's reputation. Your company can achieve both goals with **Azure**. With its comprehensive compliance portfolio, Azure is a sound choice for security compliance. With the self-service capabilities, enterprise scale, and service-level agreements in **Azure AD**, companies can tailor their security policies to exactly meet their compliance needs.

Use your smartphone or other device to view your schedule, request time off or swap shifts, and keep up with news and events.


## View your schedule as soon as your manager posts it

As soon as your manager posts your schedule to **StaffHub**, you can view it on your mobile device, even if you are away from the clinic or hospital. StaffHub lets you see who’s working with you, in case you need to swap shifts.

## Request time off or swap shifts from your device

After you’ve reviewed your schedule, if you need to request changes, you can do so right from your device. Use **StaffHub** to send a time off or shift swap request to your manager for approval. If the manager approves, the schedule will be updated automatically.

## Keep in touch even when your shift is over

Use chat in **StaffHub** to keep up with other members of your nursing team in real time, from wherever you are. Managers can even post announcements to StaffHub, so that you and the whole team can receive them at the same time.

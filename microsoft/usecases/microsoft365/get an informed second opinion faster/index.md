When making a diagnosis, confer with specialists across departments in order to deliver an informed, thorough opinion to best address patient health.


## Talk to specialists across the hospital

When you need a second opinion, you can identify a suitable specialist by searching conversations on **Yammer.** Yammer is a private social network where colleagues share information across departments, and organize around projects. When you find someone you think might have insight, you can start a new conversation and loop that person in with an @mention to alert them to the thread.

## Securely share patient information

So that your colleague has the full picture, you can share a patient chart and case details securely from **OneDrive**. OneDrive provides place in the cloud where you can store, share, and sync your work files. The Office 365 documents and folders you store in OneDrive are private until you decide to share them, and you can stop sharing or change your colleagues permission level on the document at any time.

## Work together on an official diagnosis

After the specialist has reviewed the patient file, you can work together to finalize the diagnosis using **Skype for Business** and **OneNote** meeting notes. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. If you use also use OneNote, Skype for Business lets you take private notes or add shared notes that you can co-edit with your colleague.

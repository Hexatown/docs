## Set up an Event Planning team environment

You can use **Microsoft Teams** to plan a marketing event.

Teams provides a single place where you can have all conversations related to the event, and you can store and share your content and tools. Create your Event Planning team in Microsoft Teams, and then add a channel for each aspect of the event—for example, you might have team channels for marketing, logistics and scheduling, venue, and budget. Then you can get the teamwork started in those channels by starting conversations, and @mention specific team members to pull them in.

## Store and share files and venue information

You can share files that contain information about event venues or other event-related topics in a **Microsoft Teams** channel or conversation. Shared files are available in the Files tab so that team members can review, edit, and discuss them within the Teams environment.

## Connect conversations to social media feeds

Within each **Microsoft Teams** channel, the Conversations tab provides up-to-the-minute communication between team members on that topic. Team members can access conversations online in **Office 365**, or in the desktop or mobile [Microsoft Teams app](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads "Microsoft Teams app").

You can use Connectors to feed relevant information from other sources to channel conversations. For example, use the Twitter connector to deliver content from specific accounts or hashtags related to your event, or the Facebook Pages connector to deliver updates from the pages that you own and follow. On team channels, all relevant content is available to team members with the appropriate permissions, regardless of whether its source is an internal or external application or service.

## Track, assign, and manage logistics tasks

Within a **Microsoft Teams** channel, you can add a **Planner** tab to assign tasks to team members and track progress for the event. Planner helps teams easily organize their assignments and get work done in an efficient and collaborative fashion.

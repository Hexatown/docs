Easily and instantly access knowledge and expertise to respond effectively to a client&apos;s legal question.


## Leverage your firm's collective knowledge

You can quickly find experts and resources on relevant legislation or related cases by searching in topic-related **Yammer** groups. Yammer is a private social network where colleagues share information across teams and organize around cases. You can start a new conversation, and even loop in specific associates with **@mentions** to alert them to the thread. Chances are very good that a message, a file, or a colleague can answer those pressing questions you have in a timely way.

## Instantly connect with experts

When you find the right expert to guide your client, you can send that expert an instant message (IM) from anywhere with **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging, calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration in one solution. You can tell if a colleague is immediately available for an IM chat or call by checking the presence indicator next to their name. Green means go!

## Validate a theory with the team

If you need to vet your answer with a team of experts, you can securely collect feedback by sharing a summary using **Microsoft Teams**. A Teams channel includes a shared workspace for team and private conversations, files, apps, and notes. Use your Team channel to quickly communicate, collaborate, and get stuff done.

## Answer client inquiries in a central location

You can respond to client queries and share materials through a **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up an external site for your client so that you can store files and share information securely with them. By using the external sharing features of SharePoint, you can share sites and content with people outside your organization.

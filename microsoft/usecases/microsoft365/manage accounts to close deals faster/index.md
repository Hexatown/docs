Work effectively as a team to develop strategic account plans and keep your business moving forward.


## Work on account plans as a team

You can easily work on an account, set context, and share drafts of important documents with **Microsoft Teams**. Microsoft Teams provides a single place where the whole team can have conversations and access all content and tools. When you add files to a team channel or channel conversation, they are available in the channel Files tab. Microsoft Team members and conversation participants can review file content in the Microsoft Teams window; discuss it in conversations, real-time chat sessions, or meetings; and coauthor files in Office 365 apps such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

## Chat to find answers and get advice quickly

When you want to tap into the team's collective knowledge or update everyone with the latest information, start a chat thread in a **Microsoft Teams** channel. Chat in the Conversations tab of a channel is visible to the entire team, so everyone stays in the know. When the discussion is sensitive, you can ensure that the conversation and shared documents stay private to only the people invited by using 1:1 and group chat in the Microsoft Teams Chat pane.

## Hold account health checks with the team and capture shared notes

Meet instantly with remote team members to stay on top of account progress. In your **Microsoft Teams** channel, meeting chat is saved on the channel Conversations tab to make it easy to continue and follow up on these conversations.

You can capture updates, insights, and actions from the discussion in the team **OneNote** notebook in the Notes tab for quick reference. OneNote is a digital notebook, meaning your notes go with you, wherever you go. OneNote automatically saves and synchronizes your notes so you can focus on your thoughts and ideas.

## Track tasks in preparation for customer meetings

Without switching away from the **Microsoft Teams** interface, you can add **Planner** to a tab to assign and track tasks in preparation for customer meetings. Planner helps teams easily organize their work and get work done in an efficient and collaborative fashion. Share, discuss, and iterate on presentations and other documents in the channel so everyone always sees and contributes to the latest version.

## Triage an account escalation

When an important issue arises, get everyone in the account team on the same page to respond quickly. Search **Microsoft Teams** conversations and files to get previously shared insight and resources relevant to the current issue. Use @mention to notify a colleague of an escalation in real-time to stay on top of progress and continue the conversation, no matter where you are. Participants can access conversations online in **Office 365**, or in the desktop or mobile Microsoft Teams app.

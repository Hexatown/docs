Keep up with customer demands and be productive even when on the road in order to deliver better customer service and resolve issues with no delays.


## Store work files in a central location

You can securely access and share documents everywhere you go with **OneDrive**. OneDrive provides a place in the cloud where you can store, share, and sync your work files. You can update and share your files from almost any device, and even work on Office documents with others at the same time.

## Edit and draft documents from anywhere

You can keep working on sales reports and customer proposals on the road from both your professional and personal devices with **Office 365** apps. From the App Store, you can download and install Office applications like **Word**, **Excel**, **PowerPoint**, and **OneNote** on your tablet or smartphone. Because your Office 365 apps sync across devices, you can work on a document you started at the office from your smartphone, easily picking up where you left off.

## Collaborate with team members in real time

When you need to collaborate on a project, you can simultaneously edit files with coworkers using **Office 365** coauthoring capabilities. Because you're already storing your documents in the cloud with **OneDrive**, you can quickly share your file with colleagues and work together in real time, seeing edits as they happen, while your changes are automatically synced back to the cloud.

## Chat with colleagues during the editing process

While you're editing in the same Office document (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote), you can go into detail with your coauthoring partners using Document Conversations via **Skype for Business.** Document Conversations make it possible for people to stay productive even when they're remote. Click the Chat button to open the chat pane, and type in the box at the bottom of the pane to kick off the conversation. Everyone on your team who is working in the document will see your message and be able to respond.

## Gather requirements collectively

In order to collect and understand the manufacturing requirements for a project, you can interact with internal stakeholders in a **Yammer** group. Yammer is a private social network where coworkers share information across teams, and organize around projects. Only your coworkers can join, so your communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization.

When you create a new group, you can choose to make it public and engage with coworkers across your organization, or private, to communicate just with your team.

## Create a sub-contractor handbook

When you've collected all of the necessary requirements, you can create comprehensive guidance for your sub-contractors using **Sway**. Sway is an app from Microsoft Office that makes it easy to create and share interactive reports and presentations. You can start by adding your own text and project diagrams, or search for and import relevant content from other sources.

## Review the handbook with colleagues

When your draft is ready for review, you can vet the new sub-contractor handbook with relevant product managers using **Office Apps** co-authoring. First, save the handbook to **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, so others can work in it with you in real time. By saving the document to the cloud, you and your colleagues are all working off the same copy, and can see each other's changes as soon as they're made.

Share the handbook with your colleagues, and open it to start making changes. You will see who is editing the document with you and what they're working on.

## Deliver the finalized requirements

After the handbook has been vetted and approved, you can distribute it to your sub-contractors by using **Outlook Modern Attachments**. Because your handbook is already saved to the cloud, Outlook will recognize it as recently worked on. As you're sending, elect to only provide your sub-contractors with read-only permission on the attachment so they cannot make changes.

## Host a virtual requirements walkthrough

To ensure your sub-contractors understand your manufacturing requirements, you can engage in a detailed review of the handbook through a **Skype for Business** video chat. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all in one tool. You and your sub-contractors can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on any device. Share your screen to walk through the new requirements handbook together.

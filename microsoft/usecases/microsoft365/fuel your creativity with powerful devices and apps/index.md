## Turn your desk into a creative studio

Transform your inspiration into reality with **Surface Studio**, a powerful creative device that works with pen, touch, and more. Surface Studio’s one-of-a-kind Gravity Hinge allows you to switch easily from desktop mode to a drafting table in Studio mode, giving you the ultimate creative workspace. Its 6th Generation Intel Core processor supports graphics-intensive software, and its massive, responsive touch screen allows you to see the big picture and immerse yourself in the detail.

You can also use Surface Pen with **Windows Ink** to write in Office 365 documents, create sticky notes, annotate and draw on webpages, and more.

Ensure that dispersed sales reps are educated and available to participate in marketing initiatives.


## Schedule training that accomodates multiple calendars

When employees from across time zones and retail locations need to be part of a training session, you can schedule a time that works for everyone by checking availability at a glance in your **Outlook** Calendar.  Just as you write in a notebook, you can click any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type. Use **Scheduling Assistant** to help make team scheduling easier, or add other contacts' calendars to your Outlook view and see their availability side by side with yours.

## Share training resources from a central location

You can prepare your employees by sharing training packets in advance via **SharePoint**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a team site with your employees so that you all share a central library in which to store your files. Then, from any web browser, anyone who wants to prepare ahead of time can access these resources from wherever they are.

## Make training sessions virtual

When it's time to lead the training session, you can train employees remotely with the help of **Skype for Business Meeting Broadcast**. Schedule a broadcast for up to 10,000 attendees, who can join from anywhere, and on almost any device. Add features to the session to encourage attendee participation, like **Microsoft Pulse**, with which organizers like you can field questions about how the Broadcast is going. Finally, if some of your employees couldn't attend, you can record the session and share it out on your SharePoint team site to bring them up to speed.

## Open a dialogue among employees after the session

After the broadcast, you can reinforce training concepts and keep the conversation going in a **Yammer** group. Yammer is an enterprise social network where businesses share information across teams and organize around projects. In a group, you can reply to a message to further the dialogue, provide useful information or insight, ask questions, provide answers, and highlight best practices for other employees to see.

## Spark conversations among employees at all levels

Firstline retail workers are the people who know the company's customers best, but there is often a gap between this goldmine of information and the people who make the decisions. You can bridge this gap by connecting everyone in a communication channel they are already fluent in: social networking. With the **Yammer** enterprise social network, you can foster cross-company, secure, focused conversations that instantly link people at every level of the organization, breaking down information silos and sparking conversations that connect everyone in the company.

## Drive innovation by sourcing ideas from across the company

Firstline workers have hundreds of good ideas every day—from how to streamline a checkout process to how to spotlight a product for a target demographic—but many of these ideas only get as far as a coworker or a manager. **Yammer** can serve as a portal to collect ideas from wherever they originate, and give everyone in the company a chance to weigh in on them with polls and likes. In addition to tapping a rich new source of innovation, Yammer groups give employees a voice in their company's future.

## Help salespeople find answers to customer questions

When a customer asks a question, the clock starts ticking. The speed with which a salesperson can answer a customer's question can make the difference between a sales win or loss. Wouldn't it be great if there was a tool to connect salespeople to the company's experts instantly, right from their mobile device? With the **Yammer** social network, salespeople can post questions to the network, and instantly tap into the expertise of the entire company, directly from their device.

## Build communities to share knowledge and best practices

Tap into the collective knowledge of your organization directly from your **Yammer** network. Use groups to organize retail workers so they can easily share posts, pictures, videos, and files. Because Yammer is integrated with the **Office** Groups service, members of your group are immediately connected with a set of shared resources. So when your community is ready to take action, they can use the **SharePoint** document library to access important organizational files such as company policies and product specs, or contribute to a **OneNote** notebook to share customer notes and best practices, all from within Yammer.

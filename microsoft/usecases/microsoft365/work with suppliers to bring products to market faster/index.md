Seamlessly and securely consolidate product knowledge across the supply chain and efficiently manage tasks, resources, and budget to keep product development and production on track.


## Share supply information from a central location

You can engage suppliers by sharing new product design specs, production plans, and quality requirements with them in one searchable location on **SharePoint**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. If your organization performs work that involves sharing documents or collaborating directly with external suppliers, then you might want to use the external sharing features of SharePoint to share content with people outside your organization.

## Tackle project management in one place

You can develop a detailed project plan including supply chain tasks, dependencies, budget, and timeline using Project Onlineâ€™s intuitive visual organization. **Project Online** is web-based, which means you can work on it from anywhere. It is great for managing multiple projects, tracking work on timesheets, and balancing broad resource needs.

You can create new tasks, or set a project baseline. A project baseline can be used to compare your initial project plans, or the state of a project at certain key points as it progresses, to the current state of a project.

## Host a remote production kick-off meeting

You can jump-start production by bringing all the suppliers together for a kick-off, as well as ongoing review meetings, through **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration in one tool. If you're going over production timelines you created in **Project**, you can share your entire desktop with everyone in the meeting so they can see what you are seeing.

## Communicate and execute quickly as a team

Keep up to date on progress and resolve issues rapidly by regularly communicating as a team through a dedicated Office 365 Group. **Office 365 Groups** is a feature developed with collaboration in mind. A group includes a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events so group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get stuff done.

Every Office 365 Group comes with a connected **Planner** dashboard. Your team can use this dashboard to assign and track tasks to keep production moving forward.

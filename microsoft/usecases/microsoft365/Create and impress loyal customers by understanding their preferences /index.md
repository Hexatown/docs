## Get feedback directly from guests

You can collect valuable guest feedback by inviting them to post their thoughts to a **Yammer** external group. Yammer is a private, secure social network for your organization that will allow people to collaborate securely across departments and geographies.

Yammer now allows you to create a group that includes external users. External groups look different than regular Yammer groups, so you can easily distinguish which groups have external participants.

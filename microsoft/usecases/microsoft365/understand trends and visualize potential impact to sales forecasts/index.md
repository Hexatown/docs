Quickly and intuitively visualize potential impacts to sales forecast and performance targets without relying on analysts.


## Pull sales data from a central database

When you need to review data related to purchasing behavior, you can do so quickly by storing sales data in a centralized library on **SharePoint** and importing it into **Excel**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. As sales data is sensitive, you can customize a folder in a list or library, a list item, or a library file to broaden or limit which users can access the folder, list item, or library file and what those users can do to it.

## Quickly create a sales forecast from historical data

You can discover, refine and combine external sales data with internal data sets using **Excel** Power Query. A query enables you to connect to, preview, and transform data from a wide variety of available data sources, like Facebook or Salesforce, and import the data into your Excel workbook. To create a query in Excel 2016, use the Data tab in the ribbon, then select the New Query button from the Get & Transform ribbon group.

## Uncover insights and trends, visually

From the internal and external sales data you've pulled, you can create an interactive sales trend dashboard by importing an **Excel** workbook into **Power BI**. Business intelligence (BI) is essentially a set of tools and processes that businesses use to gather data, turn it into meaningful information, and then make better decisions.

In order for Power BI to import data from your Excel workbook, that data needs to be formatted as a table. It's easy. In Excel, you can highlight a range of cells, then on the Insert tab of the Excel ribbon, click Table.

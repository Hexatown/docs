## Store and share sales guidance in a central location

You can find playbooks and sales guides in one place by storing resources on your **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a team site with fellow sales representatives to share a central library for your resources. Then, from any web browser, you and your coworkers can access these resources.

## Tap into the collective knowledge of those around you

When researching best practices, you can tap into the collective knowledge of those around you with helpful, tailored content from **Delve**. Delve helps you discover relevant information through the power of the Office Graph. Delve Boards group and share related documents. You can, for example, search for a Board about customer success stories. Boards are open to everyone in your organization, but if a board has documents that require specific access, you won't be able to see them. Only content you are allowed to see will surface.

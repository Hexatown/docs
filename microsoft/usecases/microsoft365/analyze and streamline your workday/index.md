## Track the performance of your sales team

Add to your understanding of your performance by analyzing your sales team's performance. With **Microsoft Workplace Analytics**, your team can view custom dashboards that show where the team's time is going and how well it performs against metrics. High-level summaries provide insight into the team's day-to-day collaboration, what your team's network patterns look like, and how your meetings compare with others throughout your organization. When you understand how you work and where you need improvement, take advantage of the productivity apps in **Office 365** to drive your performance to the next level.

## Use alerts and reminders to stay on top of important tasks

Successful sales reps know that sales wins come from building a relationship with customers, not spending time buried in email and to-do lists. You can reduce the time you spend on email and tasks by setting flags and reminders in **Outlook**. With Outlook, you can flag important emails to add them to your daily tasks, set an alert to be notified when an important customer contacts you, set reminders to stay on top of important meetings, set rules to automatically route low-priority requests to a separate folder for later follow-up, and much more.

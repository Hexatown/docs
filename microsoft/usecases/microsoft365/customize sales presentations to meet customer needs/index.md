## Quickly find and access the right content

Instead of spending time building new content from scratch, leverage existing high-quality sales content in your conversations with customers. With **Delve**, you can use intelligent search features to find relevant content from across your organization. Add the documents, workbooks, or presentations you find to a Delve board so you can quickly return to them. If you’re stuck on a point and need some input, check in with your colleagues via **Microsoft Teams**.

## Personalize content with relevant customer information

Get your customers' attention with personalized, targeted content that speaks directly to their interests and pain points. You can quickly identify what your target customer cares about by soliciting input in a **Yammer** group. Post questions and content to a companywide Yammer group to get feedback from experts across your organization, and create an external Yammer group to spark conversations with customers themselves. Then you can tailor your new presentations and update existing ones to be more personalized and reflective of the needs you have identified.

## Upgrade your presentation without relying on third-party designers

You can easily upgrade your sales presentations and showcase your company’s products or services without the help of a design team. Start with a professionally designed **PowerPoint** template or theme that uses visually appealing and easily customizable combinations of colors, images, and text elements. And when you add an image or chart to a slide, **PowerPoint Designer** automatically shows you design ideas for incorporating the content into your presentation with flair.

## Run the presentation by stakeholders for feedback, and update content in real time

Sometimes when you’re working on a sales presentation for an important potential client, you want a sanity check before you finalize it. To quickly get feedback, schedule an online collaboration session with your colleagues or sales managers using **Skype for Business**, share your screen to make live edits, and finalize the document, just like in an in-person work session. Soliciting input can give you new insights into perfecting your sales presentation.

## Engage customers in new ways with polished, interactive reports

If you want to go a step further in impressing your customers with reports that look professional and are easy to consume, you can use the built-in design engine in **Sway**, which takes care of making your reports look great. Sway is a user-friendly app for creating designer-quality presentations from anywhere, even from your smartphone or tablet. When you send your Sway to a client, they can instantly view it in their browser, without having to sign in or download anything.

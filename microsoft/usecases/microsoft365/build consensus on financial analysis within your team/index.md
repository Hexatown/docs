Bring your team together in a chat-based workspace to discuss analysis strategies, build consensus, and expedite decision-making.


## Collaborate on financial analysis in a chat-based workspace

When your team is tasked with conducting financial analysis, you need to be able to quickly reach consensus on which partners to involve, what the ideal data sources are, and whether or not the data is accurate. In todayâ€™s busy, dispersed workforce, it can be a challenge to bring everyone and everything together. Create a **Microsoft Teams** channel to pull colleagues and internal experts into a real-time, chat-based conversation from wherever they are.

## Easily access apps, analysis, and reports in a secure, centralized location

Many pieces must come together to create an actionable report. First, of course, you need the data. Then you must decide how you will analyze it. Finally, you need to create your report and have it reviewed by internal stakeholders before finalizing it. You can organize all of these components on tabs in your **Microsoft Teams** channel. The Files tab provides a central SharePoint repository for your team's files and data, and you can add additional tabs for PowerApps or other tools for quick access.

## Share your results with the entire team for collective input

When it's time to finalize your report, you can discuss edits and comments in real time by using chat in your **Microsoft Teams** channel. You can even call an impromptu audio or video meeting, right from the channel. If you share your **SharePoint** documents from Teams, team members can access them directly from the channel or conversation, making it easy to move ahead on suggested changes after the team has reached consensus.

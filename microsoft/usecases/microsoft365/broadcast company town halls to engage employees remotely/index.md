Bring your company s local and remote employees together for a &quot;town hall&quot; meeting to engage employees at every level.


## Host a company-wide meeting from anywhere

To celebrate company successes, report upcoming challenges, or communicate an important organization-wide change, you can deliver the news to employees throughout your company with a **Skype for Business** Meeting Broadcast. You can deliver virtual conferences with full voice and HD video for up to 10,000 attendees, who can join from anywhere, and on almost any device. Add features to the session to encourage attendee participation, like Microsoft Pulse, so that your workers can engage in real time and you can field questions about the broadcast.

## Distribute company meeting recordings to all employees

All **Skype for Business** Meeting Broadcasts are recorded automatically so attendees and people who missed the meeting can watch it later. You can also create a downloadable MP4 file of the meeting. This is a great option if you want to post the video to your **StaffHub** Team Files. StaffHub is also the perfect place for posting follow-up materials, poll results, and other company-wide announcements.

## Gather feedback from your employees

To keep the conversation alive after the town hall meeting, you can engage your employees in **Yammer**. Yammer is an enterprise social network where people share information across teams, and organize around projects. Only your company's members can join, so your communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization. Your employees can engage in the conversation from their mobile devices or computers.

When you create a new Group in Yammer, you can choose to make it public and engage with coworkers across your organization, or private, to communicate only with your team.

Coordinate quickly and communicate in real time among team members and departments, to ensure that timely and accurate information is provided to customers, shareholders, and the public.


## Set up a Public Relations team environment

You can use **Microsoft Teams** to manage public relations initiatives. 

Teams provides a single place where you can have all conversations related to an initiative, and you can store and share your content and tools. Create your Public Relations team in Teams, and then add a channel for aspect—for example, you might have team channels for press releases, news and updates, and fact-checking. Then you can get the teamwork started in those channels by starting conversations, and @mention specific team members to pull them in.

## Collaborate on press releases

You can easily collaborate on press releases by creating a conversation in a **Microsoft Teams** channel, attaching a file, and @mentioning specific team members to pull them in. Attached files are available in the Files tab  to the people in the conversation. Conversation members can review file content in the Teams window; discuss it in conversations, real-time chat sessions, or meetings; and coauthor files in Office 365 apps such as **Excel**, **PowerPoint**, and **Word**.

## Connect social media and news feeds to team channels

Within each **Microsoft Teams** channel, the Conversations tab provides up-to-the-minute communication between team members about that topic. Participants can access conversations online in **Office 365**, or in the desktop or mobile [Microsoft](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads "Microsoft Teams app") [Teams app](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads "Microsoft Teams app").

You can use Connectors to feed relevant information from other sources to conversations. For example, use the Twitter connector to deliver content from specific accounts or hashtags related to your initiatives, or the Facebook Pages connector to deliver updates from pages that you own and follow. On team channels, all relevant content is available to team members with the appropriate permissions, regardless of whether its source is an internal or external application or service.

Engage the entire team in actively planning and managing scrum tasks.


## Review bugs in your team workspace

You can add a connector to feed information from a third-party tool like Jira or GitHub directly into your Microsoft Teams environment to surface bugs for visibility, discussion, and quick resolution. Connectors appear as tabs in your team channel, allowing your entire team visibility and instant updates.

## Manage your coding activities

While working on development, you can add a **Planner** tab in a **Microsoft Teams** channel to create, update, and assign coding activities across your scrum team. Planner helps teams easily organize their assignments and get work done in an efficient and collaborative fashion. Add important internal websites in other tabs for easy reference.

## Resolve critical blockers in real time

When bugs are found, quickly find the task or feature owner, start a video call, and use desktop sharing to work through the issues together without leaving your **Microsoft Teams** channel.

## Easily add new team members

When you bring new team members on board, you can easily add them to the team to provide immediate access to the scrum documents, tasks, and risks. **Microsoft Teams** stores conversations and files, so new team members can get up to speed from one central location.

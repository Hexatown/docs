## Turn business data into visible insights

If you want to interact with your business data in a more impactful way, convert your Excel reports into interactive visual dashboards using **Power BI**. Business intelligence (BI) is essentially a set of tools and processes that businesses use to gather data, turn it into meaningful information, and then make better decisions.

In order for Power BI to import data from your Excel workbook, that data needs to be formatted as a table. It's easy. In Excel, select a range of cells, then on the Insert tab of the ribbon, click Table**.**

## Share an intelligent performance dashboard

To share trends with your business managers, you can publish your new dashboard to a shared BI Center site. A BI Center site is a **SharePoint** site that was designed especially for BI content, such as data connections, reports, scorecards, and dashboards. Managers and information consumers can use the BI content to track performance, explore data, and make better business decisions.

## Take insights on the road

When visiting field financial personnel, you can share performance insights by accessing your dashboard through **Power BI** Mobile. Power BI consists of a Windows desktop application called Power BI  Desktop, an online service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps, meaning you can interact and visualize your data from anywhere, and on any device.

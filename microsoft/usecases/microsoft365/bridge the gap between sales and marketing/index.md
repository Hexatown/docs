Improve your deal-closing rate by working more closely with marketing to generate and follow up on hot leads.


## Connect with marketing experts to gain clarity into sales funnels

In today's marketplace, sales and marketing teams must work together more closely than ever to manage sales funnels. An easy way to begin bridging the gap between these two functions is to unite them in a **Yammer** group. Yammer is a social network built for the workplace, so you can effortlessly connect across the company. You can create focused Yammer groups used to spark a conversation, post a question, or provide feedback, and teams can share content, resources, and links to spark the creative synergy that leads to sales wins.

## Tap into the wisdom of experts by sharing resources in a central location

When in a sales meeting, you can record comments about customers’ thoughts and feedback and post the comments and pitch deck to a shared forum on **SharePoint** or **OneDrive**. This forum can then act as a single source for marketing to access intel on the customer voice, so they can then adjust the marketing deliverables based on the voice, and keep the most up-to-date version in one place. You control who has view and edit permissions, so authorized contributors can make refinements and add comments in a single document, saving time and avoiding version control issues. Add a **Yammer** feed to your SharePoint site to bring ideas and issues to the group's attention, keeping everyone up to date and inviting input and feedback.

## Connect with team members to brainstorm approaches for follow-up

Your partnership with marketing has generated some promising leads, and now it's time to brainstorm the best way to follow up. Continue the conversation in your **Yammer** group, where everyone in the group can discuss ideas and access the content they need, from wherever they are. Sales reps in the field or marketing experts out of office at a convention can connect to the Yammer group from their Android, iOS, or Windows devices at any time, overcoming the distance and time-zone challenges of a geographically dispersed team.

## Easily search for follow-up ideas from marketing teams

Your company’s marketing team is often developing content relevant to your targeted customer audience. Instead of investing your own time and resources to create the same material, you can source the already-built content from Marketing by using **Delve**. With Delve, you can search on specific topics and identify the material you need, without having to know who created it and where it’s stored.

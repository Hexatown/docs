## View your schedule and share events with summit workers

Managing employees and volunteers for an event such as a summit is a logistical problem that requires excellent communication and scheduling tools. Prepare your team for the event by bringing them together in a **Microsoft** **Teams** channel. Teams is a chat-centered workspace that lets you share news, files, and tools with your event team. Then use the **StaffHub** scheduling app to provide your event workers with schedule management and information sharing tools they can use right from their devices.

## Schedule, reschedule, and submit shift requests anytime

With **StaffHub** installed on their mobile devices, your summit workers and volunteers can view their own schedules and those of their coworkers right from their smartphone or tablet, and you can view and manage staffing, shift swaps, and other changes. StaffHub also provides a chat feature that you can use to share news and events with your event team in real time.

## Access event information securely from anywhere

Your event team needs access to company documents to plan and staff the summit, and the workers and volunteers who will staff the event need to access day-of-event documents. For your internal team, **SharePoint** provides secure access to company resources from almost anywhere, on almost any device. To share documents with the firstline workers who are staffing the event, you can add the documents to the team's **StaffHub** Files tab so they can access the information directly from their mobile devices, any time they need it.

## Collaborate in real time with stakeholders and volunteers

During the summit, your volunteers might need to contact you with questions, and you might need to connect with your stakeholders to make last-minute arrangements. You can use the **StaffHub** chat feature to communicate in real time with individuals or with the event's entire firstline team. For meetings with your internal team, the full features of **Skype for Business** provide instant messaging, email, or audio and video calls. You can even share your screen to provide additional information.

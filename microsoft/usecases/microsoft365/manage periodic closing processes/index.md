## Set up a Closing team environment

You can use **Microsoft Teams** to manage closing processes.

Create your Closing team in Microsoft Teams, and then add a channel for each aspect of the process—for example, you might have channels for accounts receivable, accounts payable, financial reporting, and management review. Then you can get the teamwork started in those channels by starting conversations, and @mention specific team members to pull them in.

Team members can access conversations online in **Office 365**, or in the desktop or mobile [Microsoft Teams app](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads "Microsoft Teams app").

## Track closing information and share it with the team

In your **Microsoft Teams** channels, you can add individual files such as Excel workbooks and templates as tabs for easy access, or use a Connector to feed relevant information to conversations from external sources such as third-party task management systems, news feeds, and websites.

On team channels, all relevant content is available to team members with the appropriate permissions, regardless of whether its source is an internal or external application or service.

## Display a financial data dashboard

To facilitate your team's conversations and discover insights, you can access financial data directly in your **Microsoft Teams** channel by adding a tab displaying **Power BI** interactive dashboards. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your multiple sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

## Securely manage account-related communications

Efficient monthly, quarterly, and annual closing processes are critical to every business for the timely and accurate preparation of financial statements. These processes require departments throughout the organization to work together closely to ensure that important tasks and reports are completed quickly and correctly. You can use **Microsoft Teams** conversations and live meetings to engage these contributors and focus your team on the decisions and tasks that get you quickly to your goals. Within Teams, you can easily start instant video meetings or schedule future meetings.

## Facilitate management review of closing statements

Getting the attention of senior management stakeholders for management review of closing statements can be a challenge. You can facilitate quick collaboration with these essential stakeholders by moving the process into a **Microsoft** **Teams** channel.

Use conversations to direct the review process, and @mention specific reviewers to quickly pull them in. Use the Files tab to provide easy access to relevant documents such as preliminary financial statements, income statements, and supporting documentation such as ledgers and spreadsheets. Shared files are stored in the Files tab so that team members can review and discuss them within the Teams environment.

## Foster "face-to-face" team building

You can bring your retail-floor team together with periodic "town hall" meetings via **Skype for Business** HD videoconferencing. Skype for Business is instant messaging, calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all in one solution. You and your employees can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and from almost any device.

## Connect employees through social media

Foster frequent cross-company engagement by building employee “campfires” with **Yammer** Groups. Yammer is a private social network where businesses share information across teams, and organize around projects. Only your coworkers can join, so your communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization.

When you create a new Group in Yammer, you can choose to make it public and engage with coworkers across your organization, or private, to communicate just with your team.

## Celebrate achievements in compelling company bulletins

When you're celebrating team and individual successes, you can highlight best practices and create vivid, interactive company newsletters with **Sway**. Sway is an app from Microsoft Office that makes it easy to create and share reports and presentations. Start by adding your own text and pictures; with Sway, you’re not limited to picking a predesigned template that makes your newsletters look like everyone else’s, and you don’t have to have any design skills to transform and showcase information in modern, interactive, and attention-getting ways.

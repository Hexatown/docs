## Store performance and testing data in a central location

When you need to mine historical student testing data for a presentation at a quarterly faculty conference, you can make it easy by storing data collectively in a **SharePoint** team site. Organizations use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a site for your faculty so you can all share a central library to store your files.

## Turn testing data into telling charts and graphs

After you've located the data you need, you can import it into **Excel** and begin to analyze it in a workbook.

After your data is in Excel, you can use the Recommended Charts command on the Insert tab to quickly create a chart that’s just right for your data. Use the Chart Elements, Chart Styles, and Chart Filters buttons next to the upper-right corner of the chart to add chart elements like axis titles or data labels, to customize the look of your chart, or to change the data that’s shown in the chart.

## Use these charts in a performance report

When you're ready to create the presentation for the conference, you can leverage these **Excel** data visualizations in a **PowerPoint** slide deck. You can paste a chart as an embedded object that is linked to the original data in your Excel chart. As you continue to update your data, the chart in PowerPoint is updated as well.

## Share the report with other teachers

If you're ready to circulate the presentation with colleagues for input, you can save the deck to **OneDrive** and easily share it using **Outlook Modern Attachments**. By saving the PowerPoint deck to the cloud, you and your colleagues can all open the same copy. 

Additionally, because your presentation is already saved to the cloud, **Outlook Modern Attachments** will recognize it as recently worked on. As you're sending, elect to provide your fellow teachers with only read-only or edit permissions on the deck, so they can contribute changes.

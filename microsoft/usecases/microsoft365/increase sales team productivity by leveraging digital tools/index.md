Increase your sales team&apos;s productivity without sacrificing their work/life balance, by using digital tools to manage workflow and provide insights about their work habits.


## Manage your time to improve sales productivity

**Office 365** apps and services work together to increase individual and collective productivity. You and yoursales team can connect and collaborate to save hours of time and effort, and you can access the apps and documents you need to stay productive from anywhere on most devices. On the Office 365 home page at [www.office.com/signin](www.office.com/signin), you can find apps and services you have access to and your recently used files and storage locations. You can personalize your Office 365 experience to streamline workflow, and then add **Delve** and **MyAnalytics** to dig deep into the datacollected by the Office apps.

## Analyze how you spend your time

Sales associates need to know how long they spend with each customer, and whether they are spending that time in meetings or waiting for a response by email. Understanding how you spend your time helps improve workflow efficiency. The **MyAnalytics** dashboard uses information from your **Office 365** mailbox and calendar to provide insights on time spent in meetings and on email throughout the day. Your MyAnalytics dashboard is private, so only you have the information. Over time, you can use this information to develop insight into your performance and set goals for improvement.

## Use digital discovery tools to surface content

The more time sales associates spend in repetitive reporting and data-gathering tasks, the less time they have to be working directly with customers to produce sales wins. One way to reduce this non-sales time is to leverage someone else’s work instead of re-creating the wheel. You and your sales associates can easily locate documents that team members are working on, and organize them on **Delve** Boards so all teammates can quickly find them later. Delve never changes any permissions, so you see only documents that you already have access to.

## Connect with company experts and sales team leaders

When you and your sales associate can’t leverage someone else’s work, you can leverage someone else’s expertise to be more efficient in your own tasks. **Delve** uses the power of **MyAnalytics** to connect you to people and information in your organization so you can streamline productivity processes. Delve connects you to your business colleagues—those you know, and those you don’t—so that you can easily reach out to experts and collaborators for guidance, when you need it.

Stay educated about company best practices and industry standards to provide the best client experience.


## Deepen your understanding of market trends and investor behavior

You can stay up to date on what your target market segments and industries are doing by comparing notes with your coworkers in a companywide **Yammer** group. Use Yammer to connect with relevant coworkers in other departments, and share discoveries, conversations, and resources from almost any device. You can also add connectors to your Yammer group to feed relevant information from external sources, such as news feeds or your company’s Microsoft Dynamics CRM app, directly into your conversations.

## Discover relevant industry content through your company network

When researching best practices or industry trends, you can tap into the collective knowledge of those around you with helpful, tailored content from **Delve**. Delve helps you discover relevant information through the power of the Office Graph.

Delve  Boards group and share related documents. You can, for example, search for a board about market trends. Boards are open to everyone in your organization, but if a board has documents that require specific access, you won't be able to see them. Only content you are allowed to see will surface.

New intelligent assistance features available to Office 365 subscribers enable you to quickly and easily create professional presentations and documents, visually express geographical and temporal data, reuse existing content from within your organization, and eradicate grammar and spelling errors.


## Easily create visually engaging presentations

**PowerPoint** QuickStarter gives you research ideas and design suggestions for a presentation on a subject of your choosing. Just create a new presentation based on the QuickStarter template, specify the subject of your presentation, choose from suggested slides, and choose a layout template.

## Get intelligent, personalized design suggestions based on content

After you create the initial presentation, you can add text, images, charts, and other content to make it your own. **PowerPoint** Designer automatically shows you design ideas when you insert an image or chart on a slide, or when you enter a list of sequential or action-oriented items.

## Create graphic representations of data without hiring a designer

When you have geographic and temporal data—such as the names of cities, states, or counties; zip codes; countries/regions; or longitudes and latitudes—you can use Microsoft 3D Maps for **Excel** to plot geographic and temporal data on a 3-D globe or custom map, show the data as it changes over time, and create visual tours you can share with other people.

## Easily discover and reuse relevant existing content for new documents

Quickly find and reuse content in a new document by using the Tap feature in **Word** (or **Outlook**). The Tap pane displays Word, Excel and PowerPoint files most frequently used by you and your coworkers, and allows you to search for specific content. You can populate your document by pulling content into it from the Tap pane.

## Polish documents with automated grammar and spelling checks

Editor checks your **Word** document or **Outlook** email message for spelling and grammar errors, and makes suggestions for writing style. Suggestions are based on the context of your writing, using machine learning and natural language processing. You can select specific grammar and writing style options for Editor to follow.

## Securely access company apps and data on your device

With device security features such as **Windows Defender** **Device Guard** built into Windows 10 Enterprise, you can be sure that the data and ideas you access and communicate from the factory floor remain safe. **Windows Hello** and **Windows Defender Credential Guard** protect your device from unauthorized sign-ins, and **Windows Information Protection** prevents accidental data leaks by applying rules to control how business data can be used.

## Unleash your creativity with digital ink and 3D modeling

When a great idea comes to you when you're on the production line or away from your computer, you don't have to stop what you're doingâ€”just jot it down, sketch it out, or model it on your mobile device with the robust creativity tools included with **Windows 10**. Use **Windows Ink** to take notes and make sketches to solve design and process issues or annotate existing specs, and create your own 3D models with the new, user-friendly **Paint 3D**.

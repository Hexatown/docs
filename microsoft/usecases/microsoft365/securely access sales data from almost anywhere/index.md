Increase your productivity while traveling by remotely accessing the information you need, so that you can work quickly and securely from virtually anywhere.


## Store sales data in a single location accessible from most devices

A **SharePoint** document library provides one location where you and other sales team members can more securely store and easily find sales report content and other work files, work on them together, and access them any time remotely. For example, your team can use a document library on a SharePoint site to store all files related to a consulting project or a client. Adding files or moving files between folders is as easy as dragging them from one location to another.

You can store more-personal work-related files in **OneDrive** and selectively share and collaborate with whomever you specify, from your desktop, browser, or most mobile devices.

## Sync online sales documents to local devices to work offline

When you sync your sales documents from **OneDrive** to your local device, any changes you make while offline will sync automatically back to the cloud. You will be able to see your most recent changes across all your compatible devices, and see where you last worked in it.

Flexible security policies that align with corporate strategy, such as the OneDrive sync client and conditional access control capabilities, keep your sales documents secure in the cloud by ensuring that syncing is done only with compliant devices.

## Securely share files with sales team members and external stakeholders

The files you store on a **SharePoint** site are usually available to everyone with permissions to the site, but your team might want to share specific sales files or folders with clients who don't otherwise have access to the site. When you share files and folders, you can decide whether to let people edit or just view them. You can stop sharing at any time.

Files uploaded to **OneDrive** are not shared until you explicitly take a sharing action, so you can feel confident knowing these newly uploaded files are safe from unauthorized viewers.

## Upload sales documents from virtually anywhere

When you need to create a sales report in an **Office** app from your mobile device, you can direct the file to upload to your **OneDrive** or **SharePoint** site, and create it right from there, keeping the file secure in the cloud.

You can also upload files to a group document library from the Outlook or Outlook Groups mobile app. The Outlook Groups mobile app is a full-featured app that includes all the features of **Office 365 Groups**, such as group conversations, calendar events, a document library, and a OneNote notebook.

## Generate links from your device to share large sales documents

Sometimes files are too large to be sent via email, and when your sales team sends out an in-progress report for input from collaborators, someone must consolidate changes in the original document when all copies are returned. Working on one copy, in the cloud, is a better solution. Your sales team can share cloud-based files as easily as traditional attachments by sending a link to the document from **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, or from the **Outlook Groups** mobile app.

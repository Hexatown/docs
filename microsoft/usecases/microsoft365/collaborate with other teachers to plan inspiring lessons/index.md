Engage colleagues for ideas and feedback about lesson plans and curriculums.


## Discover useful previous course curriculums

While planning your course curriculum, you can use **Delve** to discover other lesson plans that might inform your own. Delve helps you discover the information that's likely to be most interesting to you right now through the power of the Office Graph. You can find colleagues and research by searching by a specific subject. Delve never changes any permissions, so you'll only see documents that you already have permission to see.

## Ask a colleague for help developing the course

When you want a fellow teacher's input on your lesson plans, you can send an instant message from anywhere with **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration in one solution. You can tell whether another teacher is available for an IM chat or call by the presence indicator next to his or her name. Green means go!

## Share the Class OneNote notebook with other teachers

A **OneNote Class** Notebook lets a teacher quickly set up everything they need to run an effective curriculum, like a personal workspace for every student, a content library for handouts, and a collaboration space for lessons and creative activities. You can add co-teachers to the notebook; co-teachers get the same access permissions as you do, so they can see all of your planned content to provide input. You can add or remove co-teachers at any time.

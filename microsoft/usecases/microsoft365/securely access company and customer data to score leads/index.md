## Collaborate securely on corporate and customer sales data

Stay on top of leads with quick access to all sales apps and files. When your company centrally manages security policies, such as mobile device management, you can enroll your mobile devices and install corporate apps from a self-service portal, helping to ensure that you can continue working with the same apps across devices. **Office 365** mobile apps provide security and control, so you can safely work with files while you're away from the office. Storing files on a **SharePoint** team site or **OneDrive** enables you to easily collaborate with team members.

## Use single sign-on authentication across devices and storage locations

To score leads quickly, you need to be able to easily access the mobile **Office** apps you need to get the job done. When your company has enabled single sign-on through **Azure Active Directory**, you and your sales colleagues can securely launch all cloud-based applications from a personalized web-based access panel or mobile app using your company credentials.

## Create, share, and edit sales data in real time on your device

Collaborating on lead-scoring documentation has never been easier or more secure on mobile devices. You can create a file by using an **Office 365** mobile app, and then post it to a **SharePoint** team site for the team to review. From the site, your team can create, collect, update, and manage files from most devices. It's easy to share a file by sending an invitation to a client or team member. SharePoint uses permission levels and inheritance to protect information, but you don’t have to understand those concepts to accomplish everyday tasks like sharing a site.

## Access confidential sales reports and keep sensitive information private

Because keeping private information confidential is a crucial business practice, you can help protect confidential documents by enrolling in mobile device management (MDM) or **Microsoft Intune** through a self-service company portal. Intune and built-in MDM for **Office 365** give your company the ability to manage mobile devices in your organization. Your company can manage users and their mobile devices by using both Intune and Office 365 in the same Office 365 tenant.

And, with the **Office 365** Message Encryption viewer and **Exchange** ActiveSync, you can encrypt messages and block unsupported devices from accessing sent information, further protecting the company.

## Manage device and app security to help prevent data leakage

Mobile device management (MDM) provides industry-leading device security, and you and your customers can feel confident that information is protected through a data loss prevention (DLP) policy (set up in the **Office 365** Security & Compliance Center) that identifies, monitors, and automatically protects sensitive information. Furthermore, if you or another sales associate loses their device or leaves the company, IT can remotely wipe organizational data from the device, either selectively or completely.

If your company subscribes to **Enterprise Mobility + Security**, sales associates can enroll devices in **Intune**, which offers another layer of security for company and customer data.

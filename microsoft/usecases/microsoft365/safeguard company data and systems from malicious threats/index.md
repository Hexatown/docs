Protect budget and vendor data from external attacks and suspicious internal behavior by intelligently monitoring and eliminating malicious threats.


## Prevent attacks from malicious email attachments and links

You get email from all over, and you need to be able to rely on your company's security policies and tools to keep data safe. Malicious email attachments and links are still two of the most frequent ways for unauthorized users to gain access to your organization’s sensitive data. The best way to prevent a potentially disastrous leak is to detect, reroute, and disarm these unsafe email attachments and links before they get to your data. Your organization can protect its email against these threats by using **Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection** to intelligently detect and disarm malicious email content.

## Get prompts and alerts about breaches and malware detections

Your company must identify and deal with breaches and malware attacks as quickly as possible to minimize the damage. In some cases, you need to be alerted that an attack or breach has occurred so that you can police your own devices. **Office 365 Threat Intelligence** helps your company proactively uncover and protect against advanced threats in Office 365. Deep insights into threats—provided by Microsoft’s global presence, the Intelligent Security Graph, and input from cyber threat hunters—allow your IT department to quickly and effectively enable alerts, dynamic policies, and security solutions.

## Quickly identify and address suspicious internal behavior

If a coworker downloads 10 files in five minutes, is that suspicious behavior for your organization? If so, how would you stop it? **Office 365** and its fully integrated tools and apps provide broad, industry-leading protection against suspicious user behavior by identifying, and responding to, potential threats before your data is exposed. With Office 365 audit logs, your IT department can monitor and track user and administrator activities across apps and devices, which helps with early detection and investigation of security and compliance issues.

## Identify high-risk and abnormal usage, security incidents, and threats

**Office 365 Advanced Security Management** enables your organization to identify high-risk and abnormal usage, alerting you to potential breaches of your network. Your IT department can set up activity policies to track and respond to high-risk actions; anomaly detection policies that evaluate user activities against over 70 different indicators, including sign-in failures, administrator activity, inactive accounts, and impossible travel scenarios such as a purchasing associate checking email from New York and then two minutes later, downloading a document from SharePoint from Tokyo.

## Use rich reporting to track links and messages from devices

You often travel while doing the company's business, and you rely on the security of your mobile devices to stay productive. Your organization can gain critical insights into who is being targeted and the category of attacks the organization is facing, even if those threats are on remotely located devices, by using **Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection**. Your IT department can use reporting and message tracing to investigate messages that have been blocked due to viruses or malware, and can use the URL trace capability to track individual malicious links that have been clicked in the messages.

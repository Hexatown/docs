## Easily schedule group interviews involving several calendars

When several interviewers need to be part of a round of interviews with a candidate, you can schedule a time that works for all interviewers by checking availability at a glance in **Outlook** Calendar.  Just as you write in a notebook, you can click any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type. Use Scheduling Assistant to help make team scheduling easier, or add other contacts' calendars to your Outlook view and see their availability side by side with yours.

## Share candidate information from a central location

You can prepare your interviewers by sharing applicant résumés in advance via **SharePoint**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a team site with your colleagues so you can all share a central library to store your files. Then, from any web browser, anyone who wants to prepare ahead of time can access these resources from wherever they are.

## Host face-to-face interviews from anywhere

Even when you're not able to meet in person, you can conduct personalized interviews with **Skype for Business** HD videoconferencing. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You and your candidates can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on almost any device.

## Evaluate candidates with the team

When interviews have finished, you can evaluate candidates collectively by reviewing team notes taken with a shared **OneNote** notebook. OneNote is a digital notebook, so your notes go with you wherever you go. OneNote automatically saves and synchronizes your notes so you can focus on your thoughts and ideas about each candidate's feasibility while in the interview, and compare thoughts with your fellow interviewers later.

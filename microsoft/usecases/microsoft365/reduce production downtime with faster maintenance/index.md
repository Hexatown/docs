Streamline service procedures and stay on top of maintenance activities to reduce production downtime.


## Manage service requests in a central location

When you need to initiate routine maintenance, you can do so quickly by using a central **SharePoint** portal across your organization. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. You can associate a specific service request template with a library, which is a location on a SharePoint site where your team can create, collect, update, and manage files with other people in the organization.

## Track maintenance phases automatically

You can set a service procedure in motion automatically by outlining specific workflows in **Project**. Project is a complete project management tool, great for managing multiple projects, tracking work on timesheets, and balancing broad resource needs. You can establish a service workflow from scratch, or start with a preconfigured template.

## Monitor maintenance progress

During production downtime, you can track how a service procedure is progressing by outlining your team's processes and tasks in **Planner**. With Planner on a PC, Mac, or mobile device, you and your service team can create new plans, organize and assign tasks, share files, chat about the maintenance details, and keep track of your progress. Everyone can see who is working on what at all times, reducing the likelihood of confusion as you get your productivity online.

## Address service delays through instant communication

If the procedure hits a snag, you can clear bottlenecks and eliminate delays by instantly reaching out to an available approver with **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. Avoid delays that result in continued downtime by using the Skype for Business presence indicators to tell if an approver is immediately available for an IM chat or call. Green means go!

Count on Cortana in Windows 10 to remind you of important meetings and deadlines, to help you keep in touch with coworkers and supervisors even when you&apos;re on the move, and to quickly search your devices and the internet to find the information you need.


## Keep up with your schedule by using automatic reminders

**Cortana** can remind you of important connections, appointments, and meetings based on time, places, people—or even a photo. You can ask Cortana for a preview of the day ahead as you get ready in the morning. And with Cortana connected to your **Outlook** calendar, she can use location and traffic data to notify you when you need to leave for an appointment at work or home.

## Send emails and texts without typing a word

Save time by connecting with clients and coworkers, and keep up with your email even when you're out and about. When you're driving or otherwise unable to tap or click your device, you can take advantage of **Cortana's** voice features to send an email or text, and keep your hands free.

## Track your daily tasks with ease

Use **Cortana** to keep track of to-do items, work commitments, and more. Cortana makes it quick and easy to make a list and keep track of the things you need to remember. For example, you can start a list of documents and supplies needed for an important meeting, business trip, or conference. When you have Cortana synced across your devices, you can add items to the list from wherever you are, using Cortana's voice recognition feature.

## Find the answers you need in seconds

Ask **Cortana** a question, and she instantly searches the internet or your own devices to find answers—or you can track packages, get current flight information and weather reports anywhere in the world, and much more. **Microsoft Edge** has Cortana built right in. On pages where she can help, she'll show up in the address bar with suggestions. Click her message to see how she can help you.

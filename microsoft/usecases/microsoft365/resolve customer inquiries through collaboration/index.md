Quickly respond to customer inquiries by accessing information or connecting with someone who can provide relevant expertise, helping move the sales cycle forward.


## Quickly resolve customer inquiries through collaboration

In order to provide immediate responses to customer questions, quickly connect with available experts through **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You can initiate an IM chat with anyone who's listed as available—or green—in your contacts list. Or, for inquiries that call for a face-to-face meeting, you can start your video with full voice and HD. Need to show them exactly what you're seeing on your screen? You can share your entire desktop with everyone in a Skype for Business Meeting, call, or instant messaging (IM) conversation.

## Leverage the company's collective knowledge

When trying to find answers, you can tap into the knowledge of experts throughout the company by posting your questions to **Yammer**. Yammer is a private social network where coworkers share information across teams and organize around projects. You can start a new conversation, and even loop in specific product teams with @mentions to alert them to the thread. A message, a file, or a coworker can answer those pressing questions you have, in a timely way.

## Discover relevant information through your network

Gain insight another way through people and content surfaced on **Delve**. Delve helps you discover relevant information through the power of the Office Graph. Delve shows you a mix of content from across Office 365. You’ll see both your own documents and documents your colleagues are working on. Find information about a specific subject and people who might have related information by searching for the subject. Delve never changes any permissions, so you'll see only documents that you already have access to.

## Identify solutions by tapping into existing knowledge

When your team might hold the answer, you can post a question in a **Microsoft Teams** conversation to quickly reach your teammates. Teams is a shared workspace for conversations, meetings, files, and apps, where group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get stuff done. Just like in Yammer, you can @mention a specific person to get their attention quickly and find the answer your customer needs.

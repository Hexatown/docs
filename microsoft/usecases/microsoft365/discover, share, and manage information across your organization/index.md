## Provide a single location for documents and information for the entire team

The number of documents that an organization produces, updates, and tracks is often in the thousands. When each department uses its own file system, it can be an organizational nightmare to manage cross-functional projects and teams. By creating a **SharePoint** team site, managers can provide a single location that allows team members to access the documents, pages, news, lists, and business apps they need from a centralized location. In SharePoint, teams organize information into libraries to make it easy to find, and use a version control system to make sure the team is always working on the latest version.

## Upload and search for documents in a collaborative workspace

In your **SharePoint** team site, your team can store and share in-progress documents and easily find the resources they need to stay productive. When the team's documents are stored and shared in SharePoint or **OneDrive**, team members can rapidly search through them by using **Delve** to quickly surface personalized content relevant to what they are working on.

## Quickly access all your work, your colleagues' work, and related content

The sheer volume of data a company keeps can make it challenging to find information. With your **SharePoint** team site in place, you can set up a **Microsoft Flow** workflow to notify you when a colleague has made changes to a tracked document, when a new file or item has been added, or when a relevant message has been posted on a social network site. When you are searching for information, you can use **Delve** to quickly surface content you might be interested in based on your current activity or search terms—whether that content is in a document you worked on, an email from a colleague, or a post on a social network.

With Yammer, you can post questions to the network, and instantly tap into the expertise of the entire company, any time you need it.

## Enable remote workers to collaborate on deliverables from almost any device

Today's workforce is more mobile and dispersed than ever before. To be successful, companies must keep their employees productive and collaborative, whether they are in offices in different parts of the globe or always on the go, traveling between customers, and executive meetings. Dispersed teams can eliminate bottlenecks by coediting documents in real time with **Office 365** coauthoring. With Office 365, you can open and edit documents from a Windows, Android, or iOS device, making it easy to collaborate from wherever you are. And the entire team can keep current and stay productive by sharing their notes, schedules, links, and documents in a **OneNote** digital notebook dedicated to the document or project.

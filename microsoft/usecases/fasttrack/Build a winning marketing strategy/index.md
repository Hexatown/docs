## Source info from competitors and sales reps in the field

When preparing your marketing strategy, you can collect accurate, timely input from the field, including info about new products and initiatives from your competitors, in your **Microsoft Teams** channel. Add a connector to any website, so that everyone in the group gets news about a competitor's activities as soon as they are announced. Your sales reps can also contribute real-time insights from the field with the Teams mobile app. Team members can respond to news and conversations in real time, ensuring that your strategy is based on the latest information.

## Visualize and share data to drive decision-making

Transform your sales and forecast data into rich visuals, allowing stakeholders to easily consume the results and make decisions on key strategies. With **Power BI**, you can connect data from Office 365 apps such as Excel, and then choose from a huge variety of visualizations and charts to create a colorful, interactive Power BI dashboard. Share the dashboard with your team and other colleagues by pinning it to a tab in your **Microsoft Teams** channel, where you can also add third-party dashboards and analytics such as Google Analytics and Hootsuite.

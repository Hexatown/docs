Provide top-notch guest service by surfacing relevant, company-approved information promptly, from anywhere in the hotel.


## Discover useful information related to the client's question

Discover potentially helpful information relevant to your guest's inquiry surfaced by your network on **Delve**. Delve helps you discover information that's likely to be most interesting to you right now.

Delve Boards surface and share related documents. You can, for example, search for a Board about a particular spa treatment. Boards are open to everyone in your organization, but if a board has documents that require specific access, you won't be able to see them. Only content you are allowed to see will surface.

## Connect with service experts across the company

You can learn more about a specific service or amenity by connecting with experts on **Yammer**. Yammer is a private social network where businesses share information across teams, and organize around projects. You can foster direct, free-form conversation about guest questions between service experts by inviting them to a new Group and starting a conversation.

## Store guest-facing information in a central location

When you need to refer to company documentation—such as a list of spa services—to answer a customer's question, you can find guest-ready resources stored in one place on your **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.

A team site is designed for sharing and collaborating on files regularly, especially on files that have shared ownership—like customer-facing materials. Set up a team site with fellow guest service personnel and you will all share a central library to store your resources. Then, from any web browser, across any store, you and your coworkers can access these resources.

## Consult coworkers on the fly

When your guests have pressing questions, you can get immediate answers from coworkers and managers via **Skype for Business.** Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all in one solution. You can initiate an IM chat with anyone who's listed as available—with a green presence indicator—in your contacts list. Or, for inquiries that call for a face-to-face meeting, you can start your video with full voice and HD.

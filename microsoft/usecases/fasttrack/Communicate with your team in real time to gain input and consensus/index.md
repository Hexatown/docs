## Find and collaborate with colleagues and experts via chat

Collaborating via email is one way to do things, but if you're working on a complicated file or coordinating many coauthors, email collaboration can rapidly become unwieldy. To quickly touch base with team members and others in real time, you can use **Microsoft Teams**, the chat-based workspace. When you create a group in Teams for your team or project, you can chat in real time about issues, work together on deliverables in a seamless coauthoring experience, and pull in experts with @mentions. You can even launch live audio or video meetings right from Teams.

## Easily access content, tools, and people in a secure, centralized repository

When you collaborate on project deliverables, you need a single, integrated workspace to avoid version control problems. Every channel in **Teams** comes with its own **SharePoint** document library, which provides both versioning and access control, so team members can quickly find files and work with the latest version, in a more-secured environment. You can add the third-party applications and services your team uses every day to your workspace in Teams so that no one spends valuable time hunting for what they need. You can work in Teams on your desktop, in a browser, or in mobile apps.

## Share crucial information with the entire team for collective input

In the business world, complications can arise that require timely, efficient information sharing with your whole team. You can instantly communicate critical information to your team in real time via the audio, video, and IM capabilities of **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is integrated across **Office 365**, so it’s easy to take and store notes from your meeting in Word or in a OneNote digital notebook. Then you can post notes and files on **OneDrive** or on your **SharePoint** team site so they’re available for future reference.

## Stay up to date on team members’ status and activities

It’s Friday afternoon with a deadline bearing down on you, and you need to know what results to expect come Monday morning. Use the presence indicators in **Skype for Business** to see who is available, then get them on an impromptu video call to go over the weekend plan.

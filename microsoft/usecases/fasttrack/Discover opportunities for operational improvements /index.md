Drive supply chain efficiency and reduce yield analysis time based on analyzing cost, inventory, and production data.


## Find relevant supply data with an easy search

You can easily access critical operations data such as inventory, production, product cost, and yield time on **SharePoint** with powerful search. Organizations use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.

When you search a SharePoint site, your query searches the current site and any subsites below it. When you know that the content you are looking for is contained in a specific list or library, start your search in the search box on that list or library.

## Visualize operational insights, anywhere

If you want to interact with this data in a more meaningful way, you can create a visual dashboard by inputting production data into an **Excel** table and importing it into **Power BI**. Business intelligence (BI) is essentially a set of tools and processes that businesses use to gather data, turn it into meaningful information, and then make better decisions.

Power BI consists of a Windows desktop application called **Power BI Desktop**, an online service called the **Power BI service**, and mobile Power BI apps, meaning you can interact and visualize your data from anywhere, and on almost any device.

## Turn production analysis into informative reports

When you're ready to report on areas where operations could be improved, you can create a draft of your findings with **Office Apps** and **OneDrive**. OneDrive provides a place in the cloud where you can store, share, and sync your work files. With Office 365 mobile apps (like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote) you can save your file to the cloud and access it using different devices, like your smartphone.

## Circulate the report with stakeholders

You can more-securely share the report with internal and external stakeholders through **OneDrive** and **Outlook Modern Attachments**. When you send an attachment that's saved to the cloud, you ensure everyone is viewing the same copy of the document. Recipients can access the attachment from virtually any device. As you're sending, choose whether to allow your colleagues edit or just read-only permission on the report.

## Provide a secure collaboration environment to safeguard data

Using **Office 365** business-class mobile apps such as Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote provides the security and control necessary to work with files while youâ€™re away from the office. Keeping these files in a collaborative workspace such as **SharePoint** provides quick and easy access to all the product information you need for the job. Robust mobile security features, such as mobile device management, help to ensure that you can securely continue working on the same app across devices.

## Manage single sign-on authentication across devices and cloud storage

To get work done quickly, workers need to be able to easily access the mobile Office apps they need to get the job done.

With single sign-on through **Azure Active Directory**, workers can securely launch all cloud-based applications from a personalized web-based access panel or mobile app using their company credentials.

## Securely create, edit, share, or review data in real time, on your device

Coauthoring documents has never been easier or more secure on mobile devices. After creating a file by using any of the **Office** mobile apps, you can post it to a **SharePoint** library for review. A SharePoint library is a location on a site where you can create, collect, update, and manage files with team members, from almost any device.

After the draft is saved to the central location, your colleagues can open it up for review, from any web browser, and from anywhere.

## Access confidential files across devices while protecting information

Because keeping private information confidential is a crucial business practice, you can ensure that all internal documents are protected by enrolling your business in mobile device management (MDM).

And, with the **Office 365** Message Encryption viewer and **Exchange** ActiveSync, you can encrypt messages and block unsupported devices from accessing sent information, further protecting your company.

## Manage device and app security to help prevent data leakage

Mobile device management (MDM) provides industry-leading device security, and you can feel confident that information is protected through a data loss prevention (DLP) policy (set up in the **Office 365** Security & Compliance Center) that identifies, monitors, and automatically protects sensitive information.

Taking that protection one step further, if an employee loses their device or leaves the company, you can remotely wipe organizational data from the device, either selectively or completely.

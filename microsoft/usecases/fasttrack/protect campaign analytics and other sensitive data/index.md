## Restrict access to apps and information based on credentials

You need the freedom to access your corporate email and documents from anywhere on your own devices. However, your company also needs to make sure that corporate data is secure. With **Enterprise Mobility + Security** and its connected **Azure Active Directory** functionality, your administrator can allow or block access or challenge users with Multi-Factor Authentication, device enrollment, or password change. Plus, machine learning–based identity protection can detect suspicious behavior and apply risk-based conditional access that protects your applications and critical company data in real time.

## Classify and encrypt files and communication based on sensitivity

One way to find out what customers want is to share pertinent company information with them. But sometimes it’s difficult to determine which documents include too much private company information or information about other customers. You can help make that distinction before information goes out by configuring policies that help you and your team identify sensitive data. With **Azure Information Protection**, your company can classify data based on sensitivity and add labels manually or automatically, encrypt your sensitive data and define usage rights when needed, and much more.

## Protect critical company data with document security policies

To attract new customers and increase the potential for revenue, you need to be able to track market trends. The information you collect is crucial to your company's success, and you need to make sure it is secured across all devices from which it might be accessed, even if those devices are used away from the office. To help with this, your company can use the data governance features in the **Office 365** **Security & Compliance Center**. With these features enabled, your organization can import email from other systems, enable archiving of mailboxes, or set policies for retaining email and other content.

## Ensure information security in the event of a lost or stolen device

When your company subscribes to **Office 365**, you can manage and secure your mobile device by enrolling it in mobile device management (MDM) for Office 365. Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets that are used to access work email, calendars, contacts, and documents play a big part in making sure that you get your work done anytime, from anywhere. MDM for Office 365 can be used to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices—fully or selectively—if they’re lost or stolen.

## Securely manage apps and data across devices and operating systems

**Microsoft Intune** provides mobile application management (MAM) and mobile device management (MDM) policies that protect company information in the cloud and on-premises, across devices. When your company uses Intune with the other services in **Enterprise Mobility + Security**, you gain mobile app security over and above what is provided by the mobile operating system and the mobile apps themselves.

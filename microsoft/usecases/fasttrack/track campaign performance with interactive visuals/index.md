## Collect your sales data in a secure, shared repository

As sales reports and other data start rolling in after a campaign launch, you can make sure the numbers are available to the stakeholders who need them by storing the documents in a **SharePoint** document library. SharePoint document libraries provide easy access for authenticated users while protecting your data from unauthorized access with Office 365's industry-leading security policies.

## Quickly and accurately analyze your data

You don't need to be a data analyst to quickly determine basic trends and results from your data. With Quick Analysis in **Excel**, you can instantly create different types of charts, including line and column charts, or you can add sparklines directly to your data tables. When you need to perform more than just simple analysis, you can still get quick and accurate results right from within Excel by using the Excel Analysis ToolPak add-in, which uses macro functions to calculate and display the results.

## Share your data with stakeholders in an interactive dashboard

Transform your campaign data into rich visuals, allowing stakeholders to easily consume the results and make decisions on key initiatives. With **Power BI**, you can connect data from **Office 365** apps such as Excel, and then choose from a huge variety of visualizations and charts to create a colorful, interactive Power BI dashboard. Share the dashboard with your department and other colleagues by pinning it to a tab in your campaign's **Microsoft Teams** channel, where you can also add third-party dashboards and trackers such as Google Analytics and Hootsuite.

## Create a workspace to act on campaign performance data

When the results are in and your team has met to brainstorm next steps, you can take action on new initiatives in a **Microsoft Teams** channel. In your Teams channel, you can add a Files tab to store and coauthor new documents based on your findings, allowing everyone to work directly from the channel. You can also add a tab for your **Power BI** dashboard, to keep the data and results at the top of your team's mind as you create new content.

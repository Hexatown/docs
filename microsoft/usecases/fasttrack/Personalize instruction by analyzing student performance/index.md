Better understand the needs of your students and customize learning plans based on their performance.


## Store performance data in a central location

Whether you want to create a simple class site or a comprehensive intranet containing multiple document libraries, you can easily do so by using **SharePoint**. Organizations use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a department site for your faculty so that everyone can share a central library for storing historical and current student performance data.

## Turn this data into useful charts and graphs

You can begin to analyze student performance data by pulling it from your **SharePoint** department site and importing it into an **Excel** workbook. After your data is in Excel, you can use Excel's Recommended Charts to quickly create a chart to help isolate performance issues. Use the Chart Elements, Chart Styles, and Chart Filters buttons to add chart elements like axis titles or data labels, to customize the look of your chart, or to change the data that’s shown in the chart.

## Visualize individual student strengths and needs

When you're ready to draw more meaningful inferences about individual student performance, you can create an interactive dashboard and visualize student needs by importing the **Excel** workbook into **Power BI**. Business intelligence (BI) is essentially a set of tools and processes that organizations use to gather data, turn it into meaningful information, and then make better decisions.

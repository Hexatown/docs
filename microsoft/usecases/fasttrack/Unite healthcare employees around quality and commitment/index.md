Raise the quality bar in your healthcare field by fostering a connected, empowered workforce.


## Create a "quality mindset" by inspiring corporate activism

Healthcare companies must prioritize quality—lives depend on it. You can engage employees at all levels of your company, across the globe, by encouragine _corporate activism_. By connecting your entire workforce with the **Yammer** enterprise social network, you can foster companywide, secure, focused conversations that instantly connect team members at every level of the organization, breaking down information silos and sparking conversations, from the clinic to the executive suite. By creating a culture that encourages grassroots corporate activism, you can raise the quality bar beyond rules and regulations to a shared “quality mindset.”

## Crowdsource innovation by bringing together like-minded employees

Front-office personnel, lab techs, and medical support staff have hundreds of good ideas every day—from how to streamline a regulatory compliance process to how to package a new product—but many of these ideas only get as far as a coworker or a manager. With the **Yammer** social network, firstline workers can participate in conversations across your organization to contribute ideas for new products or processes. By uniting likeminded, passionate employees wherever they are, Yammer makes it possible for you to build a truly global company community.

## Quickly communicate safety updates

Workplace safety is paramount for any company, and it is doubly so for organizations in the healthcare fields, where a lapse could mean the difference between life and death for employees and customers alike. By connecting employees in a real-time social network such as **Yammer**, you can instantly communicate important safety updates to the entire firstline workforce. And Yammer's integration with **Office 365** and **SharePoint** makes it the ideal choice for storing and sharing safety policies and procedures that employees can access any time, from wherever they are.

## Empower employees through mobile collaboration

Workers in a mobile field such as healthcare are often not connected to the rest of the company by computer workstations. **Office 365**'s mobile apps can engage this difficult-to-reach segment by providing secure, familiar productivity and communication tools that they can access from their mobile devices. Because **Yammer** is integrated with Office 365, you can move directly from conversation to collaboration with familiar tools such as Word and Excel, and you can store working files securely to **SharePoint** for anyone on the team to access.

## Enable secure knowledge transfer across your company

Constant changes in healthcare fields make it especially tricky for companies to maintain secure control over information. **Office 365** provides a suite of tools and solutions that makes it easy for you to store, share, and transfer knowledge securely and swiftly throughout your company. You can use **SharePoint** to provide employees with access to regulatory procedures, training manuals, and much more. With Office 365 Service Assurance (available with Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 plans), you can be sure that your records meet HIPPA requirements.

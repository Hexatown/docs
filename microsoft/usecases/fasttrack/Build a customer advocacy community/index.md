Advocate effectively for your customers by engaging with them in a social network and sharing your insights across the company.


## Invite customers to provide feedback in a social network

Connect directly with your customers by using the same powerful tool you use to communicate with your internal team. In a **Yammer** external group, you and your team can spark conversations with customers, instantly answer questions and respond to suggestions, conduct polls, and bring customers together to enhance their experience with your company's products or services. With Yammer external groups, you can connect with those outside your company while keeping your internal conversations, files, and other data secure.Â

## Share and discuss customer input in an open company forum

Bring the insights you glean from your **Yammer** external customer group into your internal Yammer group, where your team can drive discussion around responses, messaging, and new marketing initiatives. Keep the group focused on a particular subject or limited to your team, or create a companywide group to share broader insights and crowdsource new ideas.

## Create a shared repository to store customer feedback and promote action

When your team is ready to take action in response to customer feedback, you can store your in-process reports, proposals, and marketing collateral on a **OneDrive** or **SharePoint** site, making these materials available to your team and project members for review and collaboration. In SharePoint, you can store files in libraries; keep schedules, links, and tasks in lists; and set up workflows and notifications to keep things moving.

## Hold live virtual events to build loyalty and excitement among customers

You've sourced some great ideas from your customers and refined them with the help of your team. Now you can share your launch announcement or preview your new campaign presentation with your customers in a live event by inviting everyone to a **Skype for Business Broadcast Meeting**. In the meeting, you can talk to your customers in audio or video, share presentations, and conduct polls with **Microsoft Pulse** to get a sense of the response.

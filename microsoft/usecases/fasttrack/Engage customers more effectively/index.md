Quickly respond to customer emails, stay on top of leads, and conduct &#x201C;face-to-face&#x201D; meetings and product demos to grow customer relationships.


## Configure automated alerts to notify you based on key sales triggers

Stay on top of your game and improve response time by using automated alerts. For example, you can set an **Outlook** alert to inform you right away when an important customer sends you an email. You can also use **Microsoft Flow** to receive a push notification on your mobile device the instant an email comes through. Use one of the standard templates, or let the Flow designer help you create a custom one.

## Quickly set up meetings with customers

Sometimes, trying to schedule meetings with customers takes more time than the meeting itself. Finding a time that works for everyone can involve multiple back-and-forth emails. When trying to schedule meetings across organizations, you can use **Office 365** to share your calendars with customers and contacts in other organizations. Office 365 enables you to make calendars available to "external users," those who need to see free/busy time but don't have user accounts for your Office 365 environment. You decide when to share, how much to share, and when to keep your calendars private.

## Connect with customers from anywhere

In today’s business environment, it’s no longer necessary to log countless hours traveling in order to have face-to-face meetings with your customers. **Skype for Business** offers a real-time communication solution with its video chat capability. Use **Outlook** to schedule an online Skype for Business meeting, which your customers can easily join from wherever they are. The green, yellow, and red status indicators next to a contact's name show you at a glance who is available if you need an impromptu video call.

## Demo products even if you can't be there in person

If you have a great new product that you want to introduce to your customers, you can do so without leaving your desk by using the video screen-sharing capabilities of **Skype for Business**. Your customers can ask questions during the demo through IM or audio, and you can even record the demo so others can access it for later reference.

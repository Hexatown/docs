Easily and instantly access knowledge and expertise to respond effectively to a client question about industry standards and requirements.&#xA0;


## Leverage cross-company know-how

While meeting with a client, you can quickly find experts and resources on industry standards by searching in topic-related or customer-related **Yammer** groups. Yammer is a private social network where coworkers share information across teams and organize around projects. You can start a new conversation, and even loop in specific teams with @mentions to alert them to the thread. Chances are very good that a message, a file, or a coworker can answer those pressing questions you have, in a timely way.

## Instantly connect with experts face to face

After you find the right expert to guide your client, you can send an instant message (IM) from almost anywhere with **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging, calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration in one solution. You can tell if a colleague is available for an IM chat or call by the presence indicator next to his or her name. Green means go!

## Validate a solution with the team

When you're ready to test out your client solution with a team of experts, you can more securely collect feedback by sharing a solution summary using **Office 365** groups and **OneDrive**. An Office 365 group is the evolution of a distribution list. A group includes a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events so group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get stuff done.

## Answer client inquiries in a central location

You can respond to customer queries and share materials through a **SharePoint** team site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a client-facing site for your customers to share a space to store files and share information. By using the external sharing features of SharePoint, you can share sites and content with people outside your organization.

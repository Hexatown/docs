Stay compliant with security and privacy policies for school data to protect sensitive student and school information.


## Use security policies that align with compliance laws around the world

You must make sure that sensitive information such as student financial aid data and personal identifiable information (PII) is stored securely and in compliance with education industry standards, both for local students and for international exchange students. When you use **Office 365**, your organization has access to detailed information about how Office 365 implements security, privacy, and compliance controls, and how third-party auditors perform audits to test these controls; along with other information such as how to leverage Office 365 security controls and configurations to protect your data.

## Store and share email and documents securely to protect sensitive information

When you store sensitive documents such as financial records or student data in a central repository by using **SharePoint** or **OneDrive**, you can set permissions on who can access that information and how it’s managed. Information in a SharePoint list or library can also be encrypted with Information Rights Management (IRM), which helps control and protect files that are downloaded from lists or libraries. To protect the privacy of an email message, you can encrypt it in **Outlook**. Only the recipient who has the private key that matches the public key used to encrypt the message can decipher the message for reading.

## Protect confidential data while using your mobile device

You won’t always be on campus when you need to complete a task. You can ensure that confidential files are kept safe even when you access them from your own personal device such as a tablet or a smartphone. **Office 365** makes this possible with its industry-leading security policies, such as Information Rights Management (IRM), data loss prevention (DLP), and mobile device management (MDM).

## Maintain confidentiality while sharing sensitive information between schools

Your school can control what information is shared—and how—to help keep sensitive information confidential. The **Azure Information Protection** policy defines who can access data and what they can do with it, such as being able to view and edit files but not print or forward them. Classification and protection information can also be embedded for persistent protection that follows your data—ensuring that it remains protected regardless of where it’s stored or who it’s shared with.

## Understand how to better safeguard student information

Your school’s reputation can be damaged if private student information gets released accidentally or when global compliance standards aren’t met. To avoid this risk, be sure you understand your school’s security configurations and controls. When you use **Office 365**, your system administrators can review and manage security configurations from the **Office 365 Compliance Center.** They can ensure strict documentation for regulatory compliance, and they can run eDiscovery reports centrally for legal cases.

Your ability to get things done is, in part, reliant on being able to connect in real-time. From getting a quick answer, to keeping projects on track, to maintaining group momentum, to establishing rapport with customers, Skype for Business offers a complete meeting solution with one platform for instant messaging, audio and video calling, conferencing, and live sharing.


## Start an ad-hoc conversation

Skype for Business instant messaging (IM) is a quick way for you to contact a person or group without having to leave your desk. Less formal than email, faster than a phone call—IM is tough to beat for speed and ease of use. You can send an instant message from the Skype for Business client, mobile app or even from an Outlook email. Just check that the person's presence status is green first, indicating that they are available to chat.

## Make an audio or video call

From making a Skype-to-Skype call to dialing out to a landline or mobile device, Skype for Business enables you easily connect with colleagues and customers. Making a call has never been easier; simply hover over a contact and click the phone icon or use the dial pad to initiate the call.  Once connected, you have the added ability to transfer the call (to a different number) or change your device with the click of a mouse.

## Share and collaborate

From sharing an Excel spreadsheet to showing a PowerPoint presentation, Skype for Business enables you to add visuals to your conversation or meeting, to help drive your point home.  You can also give control of your document or desktop – enabling true real-time collaboration.  For an easy take-away, end your session by attaching a copy of the document.

With an online meeting, participants can join from anyplace or any device, even their cell phone. No internet connection? No worries. Participants can still connect to the meeting via dial-in conferencing.

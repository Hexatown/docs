## Make training sessions virtual

You can train employees remotely with the help of **Skype for Business** HD videoconferencing, and for larger audiences, **Skype for Business** Meeting Broadcast. Schedule a broadcast for up to 10,000 attendees, who can join from anywhere and on most devices. Add features to the session to encourage attendee participation, like **Microsoft Pulse—**where organizers like you can field questions about how the broadcast is going. You can record the session and share it so those who couldn't attend can view it later.

## Create and share a new-hire handbook

When you've completed the initial training, you can further prepare new hires by sharing an "onboarding handbook" via **OneNote**. OneNote is a digital notebook, meaning your notes go with you, wherever you go. OneNote automatically saves and synchronizes your notes so you can focus on your thoughts and ideas. You can create a notebook with separate pages for specific role training, and update it as job requirements change.

## Store and share training resources in a central location

You can enable employees to find answers through access to recorded meetings and training videos on **SharePoint**. SharePoint sites are a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.

You can create a SharePoint team site that is designed for sharing and collaborating on files regularly, especially on files that have shared ownership, such as training materials. You can further enhance your company's file storage and sharing capabilities by using **OneDrive** and a SharePoint team site together.

## Build a new-hire mentor network

When training is over, you can connect new hires with company mentors to keep them moving forward by creating a **Yammer** group. Yammer is an enterprise social network where businesses share information across teams and organize around projects. You can foster direct, free-form training conversations between seasoned employees and specific department new hires by inviting them to a new group and starting a conversation.

## Answer one-off questions on the fly

When new employees feel stuck, you can help them get answers fast through 1:1 support via **Skype for Business** IM or video chat. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You can initiate an IM chat with anyone who's listed as available—or green—in your contacts list. Or, for inquiries that call for a face-to-face meeting, you can start your video with full voice and HD.

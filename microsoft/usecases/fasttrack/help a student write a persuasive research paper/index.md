## Collect student questions in a central notebook

With **OneNote** Class Notebooks, teachers can easily add students to a shared notebook to allow for differentiated instruction, content delivery, and a collaborative digital space. You can work with your students and provide real-time feedback. You can create pages designed to help guide students as they complete their assignments, including a space to ask questions about their essay assignments, which you—the teacher—can reply to directly within the shared space.

## Answer student questions on the fly

When you need to quickly answer a student, you can send an instant message (IM) from anywhere with **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging, calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration in one tool. You can tell whether a student is available for an IM chat or call by the presence indicator next to his or her name. Green means go!

## Point students to helpful research materials

If your students are at a loss for where to start their research, you can use **Delve** to discover information that might help them. In Delve, documents show up as content cards in a dashboard. The information on the content cards can help you understand why the documents would be interesting or relevant to your students' assignments.

Delve boards group and share related documents. You can easily search for a board about a specific topic.

## Coach students on their papers

When your students feel stuck, you can keep them moving forward by working together on their research papers online. With coauthoring in **Word**, **Excel**, and **PowerPoint**, you can add or reply to comments directly within documents. You and your students can see edits as they happen—changes are automatically synced.

First, make sure your students save their work in the cloud with **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**. By saving documents to the cloud, they can share the file with you so you can work together in real time.

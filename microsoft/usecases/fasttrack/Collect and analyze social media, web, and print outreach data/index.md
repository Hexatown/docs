Easily track your media strategy effectiveness by collecting, analyzing, and visualizing internal and external social media, web, and print outreach data.


## Quickly analyze media strategy data to gain insights

To understand how effective your media strategy is, you need to quickly analyze data you collect from social media, web, and print outreach sources. The right tools can help you understand patterns and predict future possibilities, so your team can develop and share insights. Using the Quick Analysis feature of **Excel**, you can instantly identify and create charts that suit the type of data you’re working with.

## Present complex data in an easy-to-understand visual format

You can use the built-in tools in **Excel** to display media strategy data in a visual format. For example, you can predict future possibilities from historical time-based data by creating a Forecast Sheet, or use the PowerPivot feature to create scorecards that use conditional formatting and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as base values, target values, and status thresholds. These and other Excel reporting features provide visual representations of data that you can share with team members to make faster, more effective business decisions.

## Make decisions faster with easy-to-understand data tables and charts

When you have a large amount of data, you can provide insight from multiple angles by presenting it in a PivotTable or charting it in a PivotChart. By using either of these **Excel** features, you can easily surface the specific aspects of the data that you need to make decisions. You can add slicers or timeline controls to make the data accessible to team members.

## Quickly find other employees who are working on the same data

You can produce timely, actionable media strategy reports for your stakeholders when you gather information and expertise from throughout your company. Use **Delve** to quickly locate information pertinent to your work and to find the experts in your organization—such as customer representatives, sales managers, and marketing decision-makers—who are interested in the same data you are.

## Streamline the collaboration process by sharing dashboards and reports

Transfer data from **Excel** and other sources into **Power BI** and display it in interactive dashboards, so that experts and stakeholders can collaborate to analyze your findings and identify areas for improvement. By using Power BI, you can monitor the health of your business using a live dashboard, create rich interactive reports, and access your data on the go. Because Power BI comes with a language recognition engine, you can query the data with conversational phrases and questions. You can even build reports and charts just by asking simple questions.

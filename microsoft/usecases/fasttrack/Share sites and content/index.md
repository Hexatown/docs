SharePoint powers sharing and collaboration on the intranet. Build sites and portals that engage people, connecting them to expertise, content, actionable insights and collective knowledge. Drive organizational efficiency by sharing applications that streamline processes. Manage and share files or folders within team sites or intranet sites, and inside or outside your organization.


## Create a team site

A team site is a place on the intranet for your project, team, department, or division to store and access resources. Pages, lists, and libraries in a team site connect team members to all the resources they need across Office 365 and other services. You can manage files, gather and track data, and keep everyone up-to-date with news, tasks and deadlines from your team site.

## Create lists

A list is a collection of information that you share with team members. For example, you can create a sign-up sheet for an event, or track team events on a calendar. A SharePoint List is a place for you and your coworkers to organize items, calendars, to-do lists, and timelines. See how SharePoint Lists can help keep everyone in-sync and on schedule.

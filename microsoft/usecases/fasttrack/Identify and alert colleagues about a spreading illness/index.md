Take immediate action to review recent patient history and connect with healthcare professionals when there is a suspected viral outbreak.


## Analyze recent patient records

When a possible outbreak prompts a major health concern, you can identify health trends by analyzing recent patient records with **Excel** Quick Analysis. You can instantly create different types of charts, including line and column charts, or add miniature graphs (called sparklines), and help pertinent data stand out.

## Consult with colleagues from anywhere

You can arrange a **Skype for Business** meeting to discuss your findings with colleagues through the **Outlook** Calendar. Just as you write in a notebook, you can click any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type. You can ensure that your colleagues are available by viewing their calendars.

Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You and your colleagues can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on almost any device to respond to the spreading medical threat.

## Summarize an outbreak threat in a report

If it's time to circulate a formal report, you can quickly produce a summary of your findings by writing simultaneously with colleagues using **Office 365** apps coauthoring**.** First, save the document to **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, so others can work in it with you in real time. By saving the document to the cloud, you and your colleagues are all working off the same copy, and can see each other's changes as soon as they're made.

## Alert the team and open a dialogue

When your report is finalized, you can alert your patient care team through an **Office 365Â Group** shared inbox. An Office 365 Group is the evolution of a distribution list. A group includes a shared workspace for email, conversations, and patient information, so group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get stuff done.

Every Office 365 Group comes with a connected **OneNote** shared notebook that automatically syncs notes across devices. You can use this notebook to share discoveries about the spreading illness to protect your team and your patients.

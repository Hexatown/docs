Keep the talent pool fresh and hire the best young analysts by bringing brand ambassadors and recruiting teams together with digital communication, scheduling, and collaboration tools.


## Use scheduling and collaboration tools for recruiting events

When you're planning a recruiting initiative such as an MBA hiring event, it's important to bring as many brand ambassadors on board as you can. Getting these busy contributors together to help plan and carry out the event can be a challenge. You can solve this problem by using **Microsoft Teams** or **Yammer** to communicate with your team members wherever they are, and by using the **StaffHub** scheduling app to gain visibility into brand ambassadors' schedules. With StaffHub, brand ambassadors can manage their schedules, share information, and connect to other work-related apps and resources from a mobile device or browser.

## Securely access important recruiting event information from anywhere

To attract the best new investment analysts, you need to be sure that your recruiting team and your brand ambassadors have easy access to the latest company information. After the event, you must be able to quickly find graduate feedback reports and application data to follow up on promising leads. **SharePoint** provides secure access to company intranet resources such as training content, reference material, and company news and information from almost anywhere, on almost any device.

## Have conversations and collaborate in real time with event promotion teams

As an event date gets closer, any issues or changes must be resolved quickly. During the event, hiring teams may need immediate support from event teams if promotional materials run out, laptop batteries run down, or the table isn’t set up as contracted. **Microsoft Teams** brings together chat, content, people, and tools in one place so team members have instant access to everything they need to resolve any issues. **Skype for Business** lets team members connect with coworkers around the world, instantly, with IM, voice, or video calls.

## Create automated workflows between multiple applications

Event team members can stay connected and productive by using custom apps that provide quick access to the resources you need, such as company promotional literature and candidate feedback reports. Custom apps can also automatically flow tasks—such as forwarding promising candidate information to HR to set up a phone screen—among processes and people. **PowerApps** and **Flow** allow you to access and use custom web and mobile apps with data from **SharePoint** and other sources to simplify basic team processes and tools for specific roles or team members.

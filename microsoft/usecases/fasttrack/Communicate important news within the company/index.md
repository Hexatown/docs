Communicate important changes across the company with a personal touch, and encourage feedback to help understand how employees are reacting in order to ensure they feel connected and loyal to the organization and the brand.


## Deliver company announcements personally

When an important organization-wide change is on the horizon, you can deliver the news to employees around your company through a **Skype for Business** Meeting Broadcast. You can deliver virtual conferences with full voice and HD video for up to 10,000 attendees, who can join from anywhere, and from almost any device. Add features to the session to encourage attendee participation, like Microsoft Pulse—where organizers like you can field questions about how the Broadcast is going. Finally, if some of your employees couldn't attend, you can record the session and share it out to bring them up to speed.

## Share company information in a central location

After the Broadcast, you can make important company information—as well as the session recording—available to all of your attendees in **SharePoint**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a site for your employees, from which you can share a central library to store and communicate your company announcements. Then, from any web browser, anyone who couldn't attend the Broadcast can access these resources.

## Gather feedback from employees

To keep the conversation alive after the announcement, you can engage your employees in **Yammer**. Yammer is an enterprise social network where coworkers share information across teams, and organize around projects. Only your coworkers can join, so your communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization.

When you create a new Group in Yammer, you can choose to make it public and engage with coworkers across your organization, or private, to communicate just with your team.

## Circulate frequent, attention grabbing company newsletters

You can continue to engage regularly with your workforce with attractive newsletters using **Sway**. Sway is a new app from Microsoft Office that makes it easy to create and share interactive reports, newsletters, and presentations. Start by adding your own text and pictures, search for and import relevant content from other sources, and showcase new company updates and information in modern, interactive, and attention-getting ways.

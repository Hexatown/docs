Move quickly from conversations to completed budgets by bringing your budget planning and management teams together in a mobile-friendly chat-based workspace that syncs seamlessly with the apps you use every day.


## Set up a Budget Planning & Management team environment

You can use **Microsoft Teams** to prepare and manage a departmental budget.

Teams provides a single place where you can have all conversations related to the budget, and you can store and share your content and tools. Create your Department Budget Planning & Management team in Microsoft Teams, and then add a channel for each aspect of the budget—for example, you might have team channels for marketing and sales forecasts, capital expenditures budget, operating expense budget, and budget reporting. Then you can get the teamwork started in those channels by starting conversations, and @mention specific team members to pull them in.

## Effectively communicate with stakeholders

Budget planning and management require extensive collaboration within and across departments throughout an organization. You must effectively communicate with stakeholders such as company executives, research and development teams, product launch teams, production department managers, and more. You can use **Microsoft Teams** conversations to engage stakeholders and focus your team on the decisions and tasks that get you quickly to your goals.

Team members can access conversations online in **Office 365**, or in the desktop or mobile [Microsoft Teams app](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads "Microsoft Teams app").

## Collaborate on budget-related documents

You can easily work on a budget, set context, and share drafts of financial documents from within **Microsoft Teams**. Add files to a channel's Files tab, where everyone on your team can work on them using familiar Office 365 apps, such as **Excel**, **PowerPoint**, and **Word**. Team members can work on these documents from their computers or mobile devices.

## Display performance reports in a dashboard

When you're ready to track your performance reports, you can do so directly in your **Microsoft Teams** channel, by displaying a **Power BI** interactive dashboard. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your multiple sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

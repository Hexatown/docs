title: Easily and securely manage devices
inshort: The use of personal devices for work, in addition to the increase in the number of employees who work outside the office, is changing how organizations manage mobile devices.
Windows 10 helps to manage devices efficiently and cost effectively while reducing business disruptions, as you make new devices available to your employees. You can use the same management tools that you are familiar with today to manage all types of devices running Windows 10&#x2014;including traditional desktops, laptops, and tablets. Support for traditional deep manageability is available through technologies like Active Directory, Group Policy, and System Center Configuration Manager, and modern management that uses cloud-based device management solutions such as Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS).

## Manage identity and access in the cloud

As employees bring their personal devices to work and adopt cloud-enabled applications, maintaining control over applications has become a significant challenge. Microsoft identity and access management solutions help to protect access to applications and resources across the corporate datacenter and into the cloud.

**Azure Active Directory** provides secure single sign-on to cloud and on-premises applications, including **Office 365** and thousands of software as a service (SaaS) applications such as Salesforce, Workday, DocuSign, ServiceNow, and Box. Users can launch applications from a personalized, web-based access panel, mobile app, Office 365, or custom company portals by using their existing work credentials—and have the same experience whether they’re working on an iOS, Mac OS X, Android, or Windows device. In addition, important tasks such as resetting passwords and creating and managing groups can be delegated to employees. Providing self-service application access and password management through verification steps can reduce help desk calls and enhance security.

## Manage mobile devices in the workplace

With the proliferation of mobile devices in the workplace, employees can, and do, work from just about anywhere. To stay productive, this mobile workforce demands consistent access to corporate resources and data from any location on any device. This Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend has introduced significant challenges for IT administrators who want to enable enterprise mobility while ensuring that corporate resources are protected from unauthorized access.

By leveraging **Microsoft Intune**, you can deliver application and device management completely from the cloud, or on-premises through integration with **System Center Configuration Manager**, all via a single management console. Intune is included in **Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security**—a cost-effective way to use enterprise mobility cloud services for all of your employees.

## Protect sensitive information without interrupting users

Data is the most valuable asset you control. Losing intellectual property, a customer's personally identifiable information (PII), financial information, or confidential memos can cause substantial damage. And it’s not just malicious attacks you must worry about—it's also crucial to prevent data from escaping during everyday operations.

**Azure Information Protection (AIP)** allows you to classify and add security directly to your sensitive data so that it's always protected and identifiable. By using AIP, you can classify data based on sensitivity, add labels (manually or automatically), encrypt your sensitive data and define usage rights when needed, and apply protection easily without interrupting your employees' normal course of work. And your IT team can see what’s happening with your shared data to gain more control over it, by using powerful logging and reporting to monitor and analyze data.

**Windows Information Protection (WIP)** prevents accidental leaks by applying rules to control how business data can be used. For example, WIP could prevent sensitive internal or external data from being accidentally posted to a public social app. WIP essentially distinguishes between corporate and personal information and encrypts data according to rules or policies set by IT. With WIP, this all happens under the hood, unseen by the user. Users only get notifications when they’re attempting to take an unauthorized action, so they aren’t distracted or interrupted by policies. And your IT team has full control of keys and protected data, making it easy to perform a remote wipe of business data on demand while leaving personal data untouched.

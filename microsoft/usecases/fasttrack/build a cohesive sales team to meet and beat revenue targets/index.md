## Quickly assess how your team is progressing against forecasts

When you have up-to-date sales data instantly available, you can quickly analyze how your sales team is doing against forecasts. Use **Power BI** to transform your raw data into interactive visuals and real-time dashboards, and then embed the Power BI report as a web part in **SharePoint**, where everyone can easily access reports.

## Connect with your team from anywhere

Sometimes you just need to get a quick answer from one of your sales reps in the field. **Skype for Business** offers real-time communication solutions to enable you to find and connect with your team members by using IM, video, or voice. If your company has set up PSTN conferencing with Skype for Business Cloud PBX, sales reps can easily call in to a Skype meeting from their phones, even when theyâ€™re on the road.

## Train sales reps in company product lines

If you have a new product that you need to train your sales reps on, you can do so at scale by using the video screen-sharing capabilities of **Skype for Business**. Your team can ask questions during the demo by using IM or audio. You can even record the demo and post notes and files on a **SharePoint** team site so that everyone can access the training for future reference.

## Keep your sales team up to date

To effectively communicate across your team and eliminate information silos, connect your team by using a **Yammer** group. With Yammer, managers and group leaders can quickly make announcements to the entire team. You can bring everyone into the conversation, wherever they are in the company or in the world. For more specific projects, you can share updates by @mentioning a specific channel or team in **Microsoft Teams**.

## Build community across your sales team and celebrate success

Build a winning sales culture by celebrating success and recognizing high-performing employees. You can announce major wins and acknowledge the hard work of specific reps and teams by sharing congratulations through a companywide **Yammer** group or a channel on **Microsoft Teams**. You can also leverage Teams to share lessons and best practices so that your sales team can grow from the experiences of others.

## Host an interactive webinar to train employees wherever they are

These days, an online training session with remote employees can be as engaging as an in-person one. Whether you’re onboarding new employees or training veteran managers, the experience can be engrossing when you hold a **Microsoft Teams** webinar. You can conduct the webinar as a video or audio-only meeting from your Teams channel, share the presentation on your desktop, and field live questions in chat as the webinar proceeds. After the webinar, post resources and notes to the same channel, so everyone in the training group can easily access them for reference.

## Create a training presentation that gets your message across

A great way to get your point across in a webinar is with a well-designed **PowerPoint** presentation, which you can deliver directly from your Microsoft Teams channel. Save time by using PowerPoint Designer to help you create your presentation. While you add content to a slide, Designer works in the background to match that content to professionally designed layouts for you to choose from. Click the one you want, or switch from one layout to another to find the best arrangement.

## Provide on-demand training with streaming video

People learn in different ways, so it’s smart to offer your training in different formats. **Microsoft Stream** is a video service that lets you securely upload, view, and share videos, such as recordings of classes and presentations. With Stream, viewers can share comments, and even tag timecodes in comments to refer to a specific point in the video for discussion. When you use Microsoft Teams for training, you can add a Stream tab directly to the Teams channel so your trainees can quickly find and play your videos.

## Keep the conversation going after the training in an enterprise social network

Learning doesn’t stop when the training does. Invite your trainees to join a **Yammer** group to keep the momentum going and pull in other people for mentoring. For example, after onboarding, new employees can stay connected with their peers, onboarding buddies, and HR representatives, to ask questions and exchange stories. In Yammer groups, anyone can start, follow, reply to, and search for conversations. All discussions are saved so they can easily be searched later. And they can also be surfaced in a Microsoft Teams channel by using a connector.

## Make training resources available in a shared central repository

Keep all training resources for your company available and up to date in a central repository, so that training attendees can review those materials whenever they want. When you use a **SharePoint** library, you can upload, create, and update files, and control who has access to the materials. SharePoint libraries also offer version control so you can make sure that your employees are always looking at the most recent training resources. In your Microsoft Teams training channel, you can also add a tab to provide trainees with direct access to the SharePoint document library.

Easily work with a cross-functional team to address customer complaints quickly and effectively.&#xA0;


## Identify experts to solve escalations

Find answers to a customer inquiry by using **Delve** to search across the organization for related information and people who can help. After you identify experts, you can easily pull them into a team to add them to a conversation.

## Provide visibility into customer inquiries

When you're ready to kick off a conversation about solutions, start a chat thread in a **Microsoft Teams** channel. Teams are collections of people, content, and tools surrounding different projects and jobs within an organization. Chat threads are visible to the entire team so everyone stays in the know. When the discussion is sensitive, 1:1 and group chat ensure the conversation and shared documents stay private to the people invited.

## Search for solutions across channels and conversations

Within **Microsoft Teams**, you can search other channels and documents to identify solutions to similar escalations. Save these conversation threads to easily reference later.

You can compile these best practices in the channel **OneNote** notebook in the Notes tab. OneNote is a digital notebook, meaning your notes go with you, wherever you go. OneNote automatically saves and synchronizes your notes so you can focus on your thoughts and ideas.

## Prepare a customer response plan

When a plan of attack has been formulated, you can add **Planner** to a tab to assign and track tasks to completion. Planner helps teams easily organize their work and get work done in an efficient and collaborative fashion. Share, discuss, and iterate on response documents in the channel so everyone always sees and contributes to the latest version.

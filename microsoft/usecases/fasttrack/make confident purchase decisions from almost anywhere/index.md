## Access reports from one location more securely, from almost any device

When reports or purchase orders are stored in a variety of physical and virtual locations, it can be hard to find the information you need. Within one **SharePoint** document library, you and your coworkers can more securely store work files, easily find them, work on them together, and access them from most devices at any time. For example, you can use a document library on a SharePoint site to store files related to products your company wants to buy. Adding files or moving them between folders is as easy as dragging them from one location to another.

You can store more-personal work-related files in **OneDrive** and selectively share and collaborate with whomever you specify, from your desktop, browser, or most mobile devices.

## Sync online documents to local devices to stay productive while working offline

When you're at a tradeshow and have reports to update, you need access to those reports from wherever you are. If you need to work offline, you can sync the reports your team is working on from **OneDrive** to your local devices, and any changes you make while offline will sync automatically back to the cloud when you sign in again. You’ll be able to see your most recent changes across all your compatible devices and be able to see where you last worked in the file.

Flexible security policies that align with corporate strategy, such as the OneDrive sync client and conditional access control capabilities, keep your reports and other purchasing documents secure in the cloud by ensuring that syncing is done only with compliant devices.

## Securely share files with internal buyers and external stakeholders

Merchandise trends change quickly, so the ability to instantly share files about what’s happening now is crucial to the team and your stakeholders. The files you store on a **SharePoint** site are usually available to everyone on the team, but you might want to share specific files or folders with clients who don't have access to the site. When you share files and folders, you can decide whether to let people edit or just view them. You can stop sharing at any time.

Files uploaded to **OneDrive** are not shared until you explicitly take a sharing action, so you can feel confident knowing these newly uploaded files are safe from the wrong eyes.

## Upload documents from virtually anywhere

When you create a purchase order or report in an **Office** app on your mobile device, you can direct the file to upload to **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, and create it right from there, keeping your file secure in the cloud.

You can also upload files to a group document library from the Outlook or Outlook Groups mobile app. The Outlook Groups mobile app is a full-featured app that includes all the features of **Office 365 Groups**, such as group conversations, calendar events, a document library, and a OneNote notebook.

## Create links from your device to share large purchase documents

Sometimes files are too large to be sent via email, and when you send out a purchase order or an in-progress report for input from collaborators, someone must consolidate changes in the original document when all copies are returned. Working on a single copy, in the cloud, is a better solution. Your team can share cloud-based files as easily as traditional attachments by sending a link to the document from **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, or from **Outlook Groups**.

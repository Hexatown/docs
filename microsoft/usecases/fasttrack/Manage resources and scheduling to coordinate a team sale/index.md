Organize the tasks and resources needed to bring a team sale to fruition by leveraging powerful, intuitive project management tools.


## Schedule and delegate tasks in a shared project management system

When your team is responsible for closing a team sale, all team members need to know their assignments and how they fit into the big picture. Set up a schedule in **Project Online** to track resources, tasks, processes, and more, in an online workspace that everyone can access. Project Online is an easy-to-use project management service that offers full portfolio and project management tools on the web. Your sales team can use it to organize teamwork, collaborate on tasks, and track progress on the sale.

## Evaluate, optimize, and prioritize tasks to keep your team informed

Prioritizing the tasks on a fast-moving team sale requires close communication within your sales team. You can easily keep everyone up to date in a **Microsoft Teams** channel. In Teams, you and your colleagues can discuss client insights and relevant data as the sale progresses. Share your desktop to evaluate tasks and deliverables, use @mentions to bring in other team members or experts, and quickly call a voice or video meeting to gather the whole team to prioritize next steps, all from within a single workspace.

## Save time by using familiar scheduling tools, accessed across devices

Your sales team might not be familiar with robust project management tools, and you don't have time to create custom reports to help them understand their individual tasks. Use **Planner** to provide your team with familiar project collaboration and conversation tools that they can access from anywhere and from most devices.

Quickly deliver an educated and highly tailored client proposal that showcases related subject know-how and proactive research.


## Search for previous cases for the same client

Jump-start a new engagement by searching for previous proposals and case information on your internal **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a team site with fellow client representatives so that you can all share a central library to store your resources. Then, from any web browser, you and your associates can access these resources.

## Exchange ideas about a case

When you're ready to vet your action plan with your internal client team, you can securely collect feedback by sharing the file using **Microsoft Teams**. A Teams channel includes a shared workspace for team and private conversations, files, apps, and notes. Use your Team channel to quickly communicate, collaborate, and get stuff done.

## Solicit face-to-face feedback

When it's time to finalize your engagement proposal, you can collaborate instantaneously with your client team by using **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You can share your entire desktop with everyone in the meeting so they can see what you are seeing as your colleagues provide recommendations.

## Prepare a compelling and personalized engagement letter

You can showcase the final engagement proposal in a polished, interactive presentation for your potential new client by using **Sway**. Sway makes it easy to create and share interactive reports, newsletters, and presentations. Start by adding your own text and pictures, search for and import relevant content from other sources, and showcase information in modern, interactive, and attention-getting ways.

## Create compelling, personalized investment reports

When preparing a new investment report to share with your clients, you can quickly and easily create polished and interactive reports with **Sway**. Start by adding your own text and branding images, and then find and import the data visualizations, graphs, and other personalized content you have created for your clients, right from Excel, Power BI, or an external source such as Salesforce.

## Relay information to clients and coworkers even when they are remotely located

When new investment opportunities arise, advise your clients "face-to-face" with **Skype for Business videoconferencing**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You and your customers can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on any device.

## Send proposals and reports to clients and your team faster

If you're engaging a new client, turnaround and securely send investment proposals quickly using an **Outlook Modern Attachment**. When you send files that are stored in the cloud, you save time and eliminate confusion by sharing one copy of the document with your recipient. As you're sending, choose whether to allow your new client **edit** or just **read-only** permission on the proposal.

Windows AutoPilot capabilities enable the quick and easy transformation of new devices into enterprise-ready machines, without imaging and with the flexibility to satisfy the needs of organizations of all shapes and sizes. This process can be done by the users themselvesâ€”without IT ever touching the deviceâ€”when the organization uses technologies such as Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, third-party MDM services, and the Windows AutoPilot device enrollment service.

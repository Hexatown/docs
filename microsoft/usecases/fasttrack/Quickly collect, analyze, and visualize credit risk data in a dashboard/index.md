Win customer loyalty with quick responses by automatically collecting, analyzing, and visualizing internal and external credit risk data in a single dashboard.


## Use intuitive tools to create visual representations of risk analysis data

When preparing a credit risk analysis, you need to collate and present data from your financial institution and from third-party sources. Manually modeling data to generate insights takes time. By using the Quick Analysis feature in **Excel**, you can instantly identify and create charts that suit the type of data you’re working with. Excel has many built-in analytic chart types, including tree map, waterfall, pareto, histogram, box and whisker, and sunburst charts.

## Add data to custom, intuitive dashboards

If you’re tracking credit risk data against metrics, you can use the PowerPivot feature of **Excel** to create scorecards that use conditional formatting and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as base values, target values, and status thresholds. When you’re tracking historical time-based credit data, you can easily create a Forecast Sheet that predicts future possibilities. These and other Excel reporting features provide visual representations of data that you can share with team members to make faster, more effective business decisions. You can transfer data from Excel and other sources into **Power BI** and display it in interactive dashboards.

## Enhance dashboards with interactive reports for better analysis

When you have a large amount of credit data to analyze, you can provide insight from multiple angles by presenting it in a PivotTable or charting it in a PivotChart. By using either of these **Excel** features, you can easily surface the specific aspects of the data that you need to make decisions. You can add slicers or timeline controls to make the data accessible to team members.

## Share dashboards, charts, and graphs with team members

Everyone in your organization can use **Power BI** to monitor data using live dashboards, create rich interactive reports, and access data on the go. Because Power BI comes with a language recognition engine, you can query the data with conversational phrases and questions. You can even build reports and charts just by asking simple questions.

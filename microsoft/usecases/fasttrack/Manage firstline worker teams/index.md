Streamline the process of adding and removing firstline workers in your schedules.


## Add a new worker to your team

Adding new workers to your team, assigning shifts to them, and provisioning them with the resources they need to do their jobs can be a time-consuming task for a manager. With **StaffHub**, adding a new worker to your team is as easy as clicking Add Team Member on the Team tab, entering the new worker's phone number, and clicking Add. After you add new team members, you can create shifts for them and send each of them an invitation to StaffHub. Workers can easily accept the invitation, download the mobile app, and access the resources they need to do their jobs—all from their mobile devices, via StaffHub.

## Remove a worker from your team

Removing a worker from your **StaffHub** team couldn't be simpler. On the Team tab, point to the left of the worker's name, and then click the trash can icon that appears. If you're certain you want to remove the team member, click Delete. StaffHub removes that person from all future schedules where he or she has not been assigned to a shift. If the worker has been assigned to shifts, those shift cells in the schedule appear with a gray diagonal bar through them to show that the worker assigned to those shifts has been removed. That way, you can easily reassign the worker’s shifts without disrupting the rest of the schedule.

## Set up and provision a team of firstline workers

Although other scheduling and team management apps are out there, only **StaffHub** lets you leverage the resources of **Office 365** by automatically provisioning Office 365 accounts for your workers. Depending on your organization's Office 365 subscription, your workers might have access to collaboration resources, communication channels, file sharing, and more. StaffHub provisions an **Office 365 group** for every team that is created, allowing you to easily set up a collection of resources for your workers to share. You don't have to worry about manually assigning permissions to all those resources, because adding members to the group automatically gives them the permissions they need to the tools the group provides.

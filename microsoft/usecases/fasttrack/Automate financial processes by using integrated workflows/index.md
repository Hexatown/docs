Work less and achieve&#xA0;more by using workflow tools to automate common, repetitive financial processes.


## Get notifications when data is updated

Keeping up with changes in valuations, betas, and everything else you need to track can be time-consuming. Stay on top of clients' accounts automatically by setting up alerts to notify you when something has changed. For example, if your data is stored on a **SharePoint** site, you can have SharePoint send you an email when someone changes that data. Use the summarize bot in **Microsoft Teams** to quickly capture important points from the latest financial news, and use **Microsoft Flow** to get updates from third-party web services.

## Use automation to expedite reporting

Creating a financial report involves many repetitive tasks, such as aggregating data, formatting the report, and routing it to colleagues. The automated tools in **Office 365** can accomplish these tasks and save you time. When you use Get & Transform in **Excel** to import and format data, you can save your multistep process as a query that can be reused. And the built-in templates in **Word** and **PowerPoint** make content formatting simple. When your report is ready for internal review, set up a **Microsoft Flow** workflow to automatically route it to the reviewers.

## Customize policies to prevent data loss

Using an automated workflow can really boost your productivity, but making your information readily available for decision-making can also leave it vulnerable to security leaks. When you use **Microsoft Flow**, you can protect your data so that it is shared only with audiences that should have access to it. Flow includes data loss prevention (DLP) settings that you can use to create and enforce policies to define which consumer services or connectors your specific business data can be shared with.

## Access your time-saving processes from wherever you are

With the **Microsoft Flow** mobile app for iOS or Android, you can get notifications, create and manage your workflows, and trigger manual flows with the tap of a button, right from your smartphone or tablet.

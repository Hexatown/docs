Work together in a single document with your team to create a new employee handbook.


## Share drafts and resources in a secure, accessible location

Start by setting up a **Microsoft Teams** channel for your employee handbook team. In this channel, your team can securely share, discuss, and coauthor the handbook. When you post handbook drafts and resources to the channel’s Files tab, they are stored in your team's **SharePoint** folder, so you can be sure that they are up to date and secure.

## Collaborate to craft the perfect welcome statement

Your employee handbook’s welcome statement introduces your company to new employees, but creating a well-crafted welcome statement takes some brainstorming. Get the conversation started with an audio or video call from **Microsoft Teams**, and share your document or screen to help your team find the right language quickly.

## Coauthor handbook sections with your team in real time

You can save time and get to consensus quickly by coauthoring draft sections in real time with **Office 365**. With coauthoring, multiple people can edit a **Word** document, **Excel** spreadsheet, or **PowerPoint** presentation at the same time, and everyone can see what others are working on.

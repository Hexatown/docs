## Personalize your inbox

Be more efficient with Exchange Online's intelligent email management features. You can focus on your most important and relevant messages without losing any of your less-important emails. For example, Focused Inbox helps you focus on the emails that matter most to you. It will display your most important emails in the Focused tab, while keeping the rest easily accessible—but out of the way—on the Other tab. You’ll be informed about email activity in Other, and you can switch between tabs at any time to take a quick look. Focused Inbox learns from you, and what you consider to be important.

## A smarter approach to email attachments

Exchange Online offers a new twist on the traditional way to attach documents that helps manage versioning headaches. Outlook 2016 or Outlook on the web let you add attachments as you always have, but your recipients will receive links to the documents in SharePoint or OneDrive with permissions automatically set.  No more having to merge separate versions of documents from each coauthor!

## Do more on any platform, from any place

Even when you are away from your desktop, Exchange Online provides an easy, consistent experience. Outlook, available on a variety of devices and platforms, provides cloud-powered search and triage, smart integration between email, files, and people, and optimizations for various screen sizes so you can get more done, no matter where you are.

## Work together, as a group

Office 365 Groups let you choose a set of people that you wish to collaborate with, and automatically receive a collection of resources for those people to share. Groups surface in the familiar Outlook environment, with shared inboxes and calendars, and easy access to shared document libraries, OneNote notebooks, planning tools, and much more. Onboarding a new member no longer involves forwarding a bunch of old emails and meeting requests; when you join a group, you have access to the complete history of the group’s email and calendar.

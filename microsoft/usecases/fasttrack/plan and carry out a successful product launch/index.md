## Identify subject matter experts within your organization

Tap into the knowledge of experts throughout your organization by starting a companywide **Yammer** group for your product launch. Post questions, pull in known experts by using @mentions, and request and receive feedback on print, digital, social, and advertising campaign materials you share directly from the Yammer group.

## Surface relevant information to form data-driven decisions

When you're gathering information for your launch materials, you can streamline the search by using **Delve** boards to surface documents, websites, and even people relevant to your product. With Delve boards, you can quickly find content you or your colleagues are working on, and you can pull resources from past projects.

## Keep the launch schedule on track

Getting your product to market at the optimal time is essential, so you need to keep launch tasks on schedule. **Project Online** provides the necessary tools to help you manage your schedule, resources, budget, and issues/risks. Its seamless integration with collaboration tools like Skype for Business and Yammer help keep everyone on the same page. Some project tasks can be broken down further and collaborated upon in **Planner**, which provides familiar project collaboration and conversation tools that team members can access from almost anywhere, on most devices.

## Collaborate with contributors on your team and from other business units

**Microsoft Teams** provides an ideal workspace as you prepare for your launch, whether the contributors are on your team or external, such as executives and sales associates. Start by creating a conversation in a Teams channel, attaching a file, and @mentioning specific contributors to pull them in. Attached files are available to the people in the conversation. Conversation members can review file content in the Teams window, discuss it in a Teams chat or meeting, and coauthor files in Office 365 apps such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

## Broadcast the launch to the whole company on launch day

Make the launch official with a companywide broadcast announcement on launch day in a **Skype for Business Broadcast Meeting**. In the meeting, you can talk to your audience in audio or video, share a presentation, and conduct polls with **Microsoft Pulse** to get a sense of the response.

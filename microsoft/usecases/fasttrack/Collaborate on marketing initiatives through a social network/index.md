Connect teams in real time to spark new ideas, facilitate collaboration, and build synergy around marketing priorities.


## Seamlessly collaborate on marketing campaigns

Coordinating the progress of print, digital, social, and advertising content from idea to deliverable can be overwhelming. Invite everyone to join a **Yammer** group, focusing the conversation and making the content available in one place. With Yammer, group members can communicate in real time, regardless of where they are. You can even engage agencies outside your company in an external Yammer group,Â while keeping the company's internal communications separate. And because Yammer is integrated with **Office 365**, group members can access and work on Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files directly from Yammer.

## Stay ahead of the curve by tracking relevant trends

Marketing professionals must be constantly open to input from hundreds of information streams. Social media activity, industry news feeds, company sales reports and forecasts, thought leaders' predictions, word-of-mouth from peers, and insights from competitors' activities converge in a massive river of information that can be overwhelming. Marketing teams can organize, consolidate, and evaluate these sources by sharing them in a **Yammer** group using connectors, which work with **Office 365**. Bing News, Twitter, or any third-party source with trending information relevant to the group can be added or deleted by anyone in the group.

## Tap into customer preferences and predict requests

To learn more about customer preferences straight from the source, you can invite customers to share their feedback through a **Yammer** external group. In an external group, teams can conduct polls, ask for comments, and pose questions directly from Yammer. When the teams have the customer feedback they need, they can join relevant internal conversations on Yammer to talk about their findings and brainstorm about new marketing initiatives. Anyone in the group can start a new conversation, and even loop in specific product teams with @mentions to alert them to the thread.

## Plan a marketing event

Managing a marketing event such as a tradeshow or product rollout involves coordinating many moving parts. Marketing teams can bring these parts together in one central location to keep things in order and communicate with the teams involved by inviting everyone to a **Yammer** group. From the group, you can unite stakeholders from within and outside the company, provide access to budgets and schedules, and drive faster decision making.

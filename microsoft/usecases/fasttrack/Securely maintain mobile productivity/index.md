Strengthen user and account protection while maintaining a high level of productivity and mobility by using innovative, identity-driven security techniques.


## Work more securely from anywhere, on almost any device

How can you retain the flexibility you need to get out into the world and do your job, and still be sure that your company's data remains secure? **Azure Active Directory (AD) Premium** helps protect your data with identity and access management in the cloud. It works with iOS, Mac OS X, Android, and Windows devices, so you can rely on its enterprise-grade security from wherever you are. Sign in faster and more securely to your device with **Windows Hello**, and work on the same app across devices with the robust mobile security features of **Windows 10 Enterprise**.

## Maintain a high level of productivity while helping protect sensitive data

Maintaining tight and thorough security for your data does not mean that you need to spend more of your valuable time in complicated sign-in, identity authentication, and credential update processes. As security needs have grown, the security tools in the Microsoft toolbox have kept one step ahead, while ensuring an efficient and intuitive end-user experience. **Azure AD Premium** provides single sign-on to any cloud and on-premises web app, ensuring fast access to the work files and apps you need while helping to protect your data, and **Windows 10 Enterprise** helps you stay productive and secure from wherever you are.

## Manage and maintain accounts more securely across all apps

The integration of the apps you work with is key to your productivity. Because **Azure AD Premium** and **Office 365** are fully integrated, Azure AD's robust security umbrella covers all of the apps you work with, preserving the mobile and desktop experiences you need to keep working with your favorite apps and tools. All Office 365 apps, including familiar productivity apps such as Excel and PowerPoint, and new enterprise social networking apps such as Yammer and Teams, fall under this umbrella, providing peace of mind as you manage account information and stay productive.

## Use advanced sign-in methods for more secure user authentication

Secure, convenient sign-in has been a necessity since people started communicating across the internet. By using **Windows Hello**, you can sign in to your devices, apps, online services, and networks by using facial, iris, or fingerprint recognition, making it easy for you to stay productive while helping to ensure that the company's data stays secure. **Credential Guard**, an integrated part of **Windows 10 Enterprise**, uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them.

## Protect user account information while maintaining compliance

You need to be able to access user account information quickly and easily to do your job. Your company needs to ensure that access to this information is protected to meet their security compliance regulations. This pull-push tension could result in a work slowdown if the best enterprise-grade security tools and services are not used. As the cloud platform with the largest compliance portfolio, **Azure** is an ideal choice for security compliance. With the self-service capabilities, enterprise scale, and service-level agreements in **Azure AD**, companies can tailor their security policies to meet their compliance needs.

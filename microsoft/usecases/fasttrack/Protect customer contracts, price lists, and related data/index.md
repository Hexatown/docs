Keep contracts, price lists, and related data more secure with appropriate permissions, policies, and access management.


## Securely access customer information based on your credentials

You often juggle multiple clients, and keeping client data safe no matter where or on what device you are working is crucial. **Azure Active Directory** (Azure AD) conditional access offers simple ways to help your organization secure resources in the cloud and on-premises. Conditional access policies like multi-factor authentication can help protect against the risk of stolen and phished credentials. In addition to requiring credentials, your company might have a policy that only devices that are enrolled in a mobile device management system like Microsoft Intune can access your company’s sensitive services.

## Easily label, classify, and encrypt sales documents based on level of sensitivity

With all the documents that you create—customer contact lists, bills of price, and other documents—it’s nearly impossible to stay on top of which files are for only internal viewing versus those that can be shared externally.

**Azure Information Protection** can take those decisions out of your hands. Azure Information Protection can classify data at the time of creation or modification, either automatically or manually. After a document is classified and labeled, it can also be encrypted, which requires you to authenticate to access the data, and enforces user rights that define what can be done with the data.

## Encrypt companywide communications and protect critical data

**Office 365** provides you with multiple layers and kinds of encryption working together to secure your files. When you use **SharePoint** or **OneDrive** to store sensitive documents, IT or managers can set permissions that determine who can access that information and how it’s managed. When your company uses **Information Rights Management** (IRM), information in a SharePoint list or library is encrypted so that only authorized people can view files.

When your company’s email server is hosted through Office 365 and **Exchange Online**, you can feel comfortable knowing that your communications are protected with **Office Message Encryption** and, again, IRM.

## Keep information secure if a device is lost or stolen

As a sales rep, you often work remotely, and you can help the company keep information secure on your devices by enrolling in mobile device management (MDM) for **Office 365**. Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets that are used to access work email, calendars, contacts, and documents play a big part in making sure that you get your work done anytime, from anywhere. Your company can use MDM for Office 365 to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices—fully or selectively—if they’re lost or stolen.

## Securely manage files on different operating systems

When the company offers a BYOD program that includes **Intune**, you can enroll your personal devices and protect corporate data more securely. Intune provides mobile management policies that protect company information in the cloud and on-premises, across devices and operating systems. When the company uses Intune with the other services in **Enterprise Mobility + Security**, you are provided with mobile app security over and above what is provided by the mobile operating system and the mobile apps themselves through app configuration.

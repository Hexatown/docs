## Set up an RFP/Proposal Generation team environment

You can use **Microsoft Teams** to generate requests for proposal (RFPs) and proposals. 

Teams provides a single place where the whole team can have conversations related to the RFP or proposal, and access all related content and tools. Create your RFP/Proposal Generation team in Teams, and then add a channel for each aspect of the work—for example, you might have team channels for project management, proposal deliverables, and budget. Then you can get the teamwork started in those channels by starting conversations, and @mention specific team members to pull them in.

## Track and assign tasks

Whether your team is generating or responding to an RFP, the process involves many departments throughout the company, working together to compile relevant questions or responses and supporting documentation. Within a  **Microsoft Teams** channel, you can add a **Planner** tab to assign tasks to team members and track progress for the RFP or proposal. Planner helps teams easily organize their assignments and get work done in an efficient and collaborative fashion.

## Compile the deliverables for an RFP or proposal

The **Microsoft Teams** mobile-friendly chat-based workspace brings your team together with ready access to the documents, tools, and people they need to compile a complete and accurate RFP or response.  For example, in the Files tab of the Proposal Deliverables channel, you can store and share relevant supporting documents and the RFP or response document you’re working on. Shared files are stored in the Files tab so that team members can review and discuss them within the Teams environment.

## Track budgeting activities

Within a **Microsoft Teams**  channel, you can display frequently accessed files, such as a budget spreadsheet or a template for RFP questions or responses, on individual tabs for easy access. You can also connect to external content  such as an existing third-party task management system (like Asana, Pivotal Tracker, or Trello) or customer or vendor websites. All relevant content is available in Teams, regardless of whether its source is an internal or external application or service.

## Stay productive by avoiding delays due to compliance concerns

Staying productive but keeping your data secure in the office and on business trips is crucial. With easy-to-use **Office 365** mobile and desktop apps that help ensure security, privacy, and compliance, you get the best of both worlds.

Storing company information in a central repository such as **SharePoint** ensures that information is easy to find, and after content is updated on one device, any changes automatically sync to all devices. With permission levels set and rights management protection policies enabled, you can quickly but securely share files with the people who need them.

## Maintain compliance across documents and devices

You can manage and secure the mobile devices you rely on when you're away from the office by using mobile device management for **Office 365**. Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets that are used to access work email, calendars, contacts, and documents play a big part in making sure that you get your work done, wherever you are. Your company can use MDM for Office 365 to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices if theyâ€™re lost or stolen.

Improve your lab&#x2019;s testing operations and ensure regulatory compliance by using powerful, modern devices.


## Access lab results digitally for efficiency and compliance

Enjoy easy, mobile access to lab results from your **Microsoft 365 powered device**, wherever you are—at your workstation, in a meeting, or even offsite. With the industry-leading security built into Microsoft 365 powered devices, in addition to the technical and administrative safeguards your organization can configure in **Windows 10** to comply with HIPAA and other requirements, you can be sure that your data remains secure and in compliance while still being readily accessible.

## Easily organize large amounts of data

Each day, your lab processes and analyzes thousands of biological samples. Whether the test is to simply determine a patient’s blood type or to test for diabetes or cancer, you know that the success of a patient’s treatment plan depends on the accuracy and timeliness of these tests. When everyone in your lab has a **Microsoft 365 powered device**, they can quickly upload and access the data they need in a secure and reliable central database hosted on Azure (Microsoft Cloud).

## Track instrument calibration records for compliance

In addition to storing and accessing data securely, your lab needs to constantly test instruments to ensure that they are always operational and calibrated to meet regulatory requirements. With the security and manageability offered by modern **Microsoft 365 powered devices**, you can track all scheduled instrument activity from your device, and receive notifications with a chain of alerts until a required task is completed. Store your instrument records in a centralized database hosted on **Microsoft Azure** to record and review equipment status, access records, and run audit reports, all in real time.

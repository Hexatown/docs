## Transform workforce data into actionable insights

Use Recommended Charts in **Excel** to quickly create a chart to aggregate and display diversity data for analysis and discussion with your team. Excel makes it easy to customize the look of your chart or change the data thatâ€™s shown in the chart, so that you can highlight the points that will lead your team to insights and decisions.

## Visualize workforce diversity trends for easier analysis

Graphs and charts present data in relatively simple formats, but to pinpoint trends, it can be useful to present your data in new ways, to gain insights that traditional charts can't provide. You can import your data from **Excel** into **Power BI** and use a wide range of visualizations, from simple bar charts to pie charts to maps, and even more esoteric offerings like waterfalls, funnels, gauges, and more. Power BI Desktop also offers extensive page formatting tools, such as shapes and images, that help bring your data to life.

## Compare your findings to the latest industry data

After you know your own workplace makeup, you might want to compare it to industry norms. Connect to a wide range of data sources, including on-premises databases, Excel workbooks, and cloud services, by using **Power BI** Desktop. You can connect to data sources, preview the data, clean it, and import it.

## Share data dashboards and reports in a single workspace

When your diversity data is in **Power BI**, you can display it in interactive dashboards. A Power BI dashboard is a single page that uses visualizations to tell a story. The visualizations on a dashboard come from reports, and each report is based on one dataset. A dashboard provides a consolidated view regardless of where your data lives. Share your dashboard so that you can collaborate and discuss your data with teammates.

Using StaffHub online or the StaffHub mobile app, staff workers can view schedules, swap shifts, and request time off.


## Access scheduling information from any device

When a supervisor adds you to **StaffHub**, you’ll receive an email or text invitation. Open the message on your mobile device, click the link, and follow the instructions to install the StaffHub app on your Android or iOS mobile device. You’ll need to provide your Google Play or iTunes credentials.

Launch the mobile app and sign in with your Office 365 work account to view and manage your current and upcoming shifts on the My Shifts tab. You can also view (but not manage) your schedule in any web browser by signing in to [StaffHub](http://staffhub.ms).

## Swap shifts with another worker

You can offer to exchange or give away scheduled shifts directly from the **StaffHub** app. You simply choose the shift you want to change, select the change options, and send the request to your coworker. If your coworker approves the request, StaffHub sends it to the supervisor for approval. If the supervisor approves the shift swap, StaffHub automatically updates the schedule.

## Request time off

Use the **StaffHub** mobile app to easily request paid or unpaid time off for an upcoming vacation, family leave, or other reason, directly from your mobile device. StaffHub sends your request to a supervisor for approval. If the request is approved, StaffHub automatically blocks that time off so you aren’t scheduled for a shift.

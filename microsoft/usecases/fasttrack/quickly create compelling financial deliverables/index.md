## Centralize team collaboration

Collaborate and communicate efficiently as a team to review expense reports and budgets, allocate capital resources, and more through a dedicated **Office 365** group. Office 365 Groups is a feature developed with collaboration in mind. A group includes a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events so group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get things done.

## Share a central document library

By using your **Office 365** group's shared document library in **SharePoint**, you can expedite deliverable review cycles by tracking contributions and feedback on the same file. When you create a file or folder in the group’s Documents library, it is automatically shared with all members of the group. If you add members to the group, they also automatically get access to the files.

## Finalize the deliverable with your colleagues in real time

When you're ready to finalize the deliverable, seek collective agreement from your team members in real time by using coauthoring in **Office 365** apps. Because the file is already saved to the cloud in your group's **SharePoint** document library, everyone can work in the document with you at the same time. By saving the document to the cloud, you and your colleagues are all working off the same copy, and can see each other's changes as soon as they're made.

## Create data visualizations to bring financial analysis to life

Financial data can be complex, but you can make it more compelling and easier to consume by presenting it with infographics, such as waterfalls, bubble charts, 3D maps, or sparklines in **Excel**. You can also transfer the data from Excel into **Power BI** and display it in interactive dashboards, so that financial analysists can easily view and understand your findings.

## Track time spent in meetings, on email, and during focus hours

Do you ever wonder where your day went? The **MyAnalytics** dashboard uses information from your **Office 365** mailbox and calendar to provide insights on the time you spend in meetings and on email over the course of the day. Your MyAnalytics dashboard is private, so only you have the information. Use these insights to gain awareness of how you work; you can then set goals and optimize your time for the highest impact.

Delve connects you to your business colleagues—those you know, and those you don’t—so that you can easily reach out to experts and collaborators for guidance, when you need it.

## Discover what your colleagues are working on

You can easily locate documents that team members are working on, and organize them on **Delve** Boards so you can quickly find them later. Delve never changes any permissions, so you'll see only documents that you already have access to.

## Easily schedule meetings accomodating multiple calendars

When branch managers from across timezones and company locations need to be part of a meeting, you can schedule a time that works for everyone by checking availability at-a-glance in **Outlook** Calendar.  Just as you write in a notebook, you can click any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type. Use Scheduling Assistant to help make team scheduling easier, or you can add other contact's calendars to your Outlook view and see their availability side by side with yours.

## Touch base with managers "face-to-face"

You can bring your branch managers together for periodic "town hall" meetings via **Skype for Business** HD videoconferencing. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing and collaboration all in one solution. You and your employees can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on any device, and even record these meetings for future reference.

## Share meeting files in a central location

After the meeting,  you can make the branch analysis files—as well as the recording of the meeting—available to all of your attendees on a **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.

Set up a team site with your managers and you will all share a central library to store your files. Then, from any web browser, anyone who couldn't attend the meeting can access these resources.

## Poll branch managers for feedback and ideas

To ensure that feedback is flowing freely from the various company branches, you can start a new group in **Yammer**. Yammer is an enterprise social network where coworkers share information across teams, and organize around projects. Only your coworkers can join, so your communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization.

When you create a new Group, you can choose to make it public and engage with coworkers across your organization, or private, to communicate just with your team.

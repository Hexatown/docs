Facilitate zero-friction, transparent work communication&#xA0;to complete a client project on time.


## Tackle project management in one place

You can provide full visibility into project tasks, timelines, dependencies, and responsibilities, and make it easy for team members to log billable time by using **Project Online**. Project Online is web-based, so you can work on it from anywhere. It's great for managing multiple projects, tracking work on timesheets, and balancing broad resource needs. You can create new tasks and set a project baseline. A project baseline can be used to compare your initial project plans, or the state of a project at certain key points as it progresses, to the project's current state.

## Share project files in a central location

To streamline collaboration on ongoing shared work, you can store your working documents in a **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a team site with your project team so you can all share a central library to store your resources. Then, from any web browser, you and your associates can access these resources.

## Keep team members in the loop about project delays

If a project deliverable is falling behind, you can quickly alert the team through the project’s **Microsoft Teams** channel. A Teams channel includes a shared workspace for team and private conversations, files, apps, and notes. In Teams, you can alert a specific team member about the delay by using an @mention in your post.

## Keep the conversation going after deliverables are sent

As deliverables are finalized and sent to the client, you can foster ongoing ad hoc communications and coordination in a dedicated **Yammer** group. Yammer is a private social network where coworkers share information across teams, and organize around projects. Only your coworkers can join, so your communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization. When you create a new group, you can choose to make it public and engage with coworkers across your organization.

Ensure that your promotional events are successful by providing firstline workers with modern digital communication, scheduling, and collaboration tools they can use from the event floor.


## Schedule, reschedule, and submit shift requests anytime, from anywhere

A promotional event needs sales coverage, but not every salesperson can attend, and sometimes a salesperson needs to swap shifts with someone at the last minute. **StaffHub** helps sales team members manage their promotional events shifts with schedule management, information sharing, and the ability to connect to other work-related apps and resources from a mobile device or browser. In addition, with StaffHub installed on their mobile devices, sales team members can view their own schedules and those of their coworkers right from their smartphone or tablet.

## Share event news and updates with the sales team in real time

Often, sales reps travel from one event to the next without touching down at the office in between. To keep them “in the loop” with company decisions and the company culture, add **StaffHub** to your set of tools. In addition to its intuitive firstline scheduling features, StaffHub provides a chat feature that team members can use to share news and events with coworkers in real time. For a more robust chat experience, **Yammer** lets your sales team discuss ideas, share updates, and crowdsource answers from coworkers across the organization.

## Securely access the latest versions of product documentation from anywhere

To make sure that your promotional events include the latest product information and messaging, you need to be sure that your sales team has easy access to the latest marketing collateral and product specs, even when they are on the road. **SharePoint** provides more secure access to company intranet resources such as marketing content, product look books and catalogs, and company news and information from almost anywhere, on almost any device.

## Have conversations and collaborate in real time with other sales teams

When you're preparing for an event, any issues or changes must be resolved quickly. During the event, sales teams may need immediate support if promotional materials run out, laptop batteries run down, or the table isn’t set up as contracted. **Microsoft Teams** brings together chat, content, people, and tools in one place so team members have instant access to everything they need to resolve any issues. **Skype for Business** lets team members connect with coworkers around the world, instantly, with IM, voice, or video calls.

## Aggregate sales data by creating automated workflows and custom apps

With **PowerApps**, you can easily create custom apps that provide quick access to data from an event, such as customer feedback reports, without having to write a single line of code. By using **Microsoft Flow**, you can also automatically flow tasks—such as consolidating feedback, sending or receiving notifications, and collecting and organizing new sales data. PowerApps and Flow allow you to access and use custom web and mobile apps with data from **SharePoint** and other sources so you can easily access the company data and tools you need.

Inspire confidence from your clients or your team by analyzing your data quickly and accurately.


## Analyze your data instantly

In the fast-paced world of finance, you need to be able to perform simple data analysis quickly and accurately. Luckily, everything you need for robust data analysis is in the same **Excel** workbook in which you store your data. Use Quick Analysis in Excel to quickly create a wide variety of charts, from a simple line chart to a 3D map, or add sparklines (miniature graphs) directly to your tables. You can also create PivotTables, quickly insert totals, and apply conditional formatting, all with just a few clicks.

## Visualize and analyze your data from all angles

Being able to quickly analyze data can help you make better business decisions. But sometimes it’s hard to know where to start, especially when you have a lot of data. **Excel** PivotTables are a great way to summarize, analyze, explore, and present your data, and you can create them with just a few clicks. PivotTables are highly flexible and can be quickly adjusted depending on how you need to display your results. You can also create PivotCharts based on PivotTables that will automatically update when your PivotTables do.

## Quickly conduct a what-if analysis

Occasionally you need to present data in different what-if scenarios for decision-making. With **Excel**, there's no need to create a complex business model. You can use the What-if Analysis tools built into Excel to pull several different sets of values in one or more formulas to explore various results. For example, you can build two budgets that each assumes a certain level of revenue, or you can specify a result that you want a formula to produce, and then determine what sets of values will produce that result.

## Easily perform complex analysis by using a ready-made toolkit

When you need to perform more than just simple analysis, you can still get quick and accurate results right from within **Excel**, with the Excel Analysis ToolPak add-in. With the ToolPak, you provide the data and parameters for each analysis, and the tool uses the appropriate macro functions to calculate and display the results in an output table, sometimes with an accompanying chart. The Analysis ToolPak includes tools such as correlation, covariance, regression, and much more.

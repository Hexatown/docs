Microsoft 365 is a universal toolkit for teamwork, serving multiple team needs while providing a seamless experience across apps and services. Avoid multiple sign-ins across unconnected apps, security risks due to noncompliant software, and duplicative tools that strain team productivity. Microsoft 365 provides a single membership across apps and services with Office 365 Groups, suite-wide intelligence with the Microsoft Graph, and security and compliance.


## Use group email and calendars to stay in sync with your team

Microsoft 365 is built on an intelligent fabric that includes Office 365 Groups, a membership service that easily creates a single team identity across apps and services. In Outlook, you can take advantage of this service to:

*   Upgrade your distribution lists to group inboxes with shared assets
*   Share updates with your group in email
*   Keep your group in sync with a shared calendar

## Use a secure, centralized location for intranets and content management

Use a SharePoint team site to provide your team with a single source of truth for your deliverables and supporting content. With SharePoint, you can:

*   Create a company intranet for news and resources
*   Automate document workflows and share lists
*   Share and work together on all your files with OneDrive

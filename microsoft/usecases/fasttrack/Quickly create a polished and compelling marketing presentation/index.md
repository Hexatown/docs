Catch your customers&apos; interest with a polished presentation, without relying on expensive and time-consuming professional design services.


## Brainstorm presentation ideas with your team in a virtual workspace

When brainstorming your presentation's approach, you can tap into the collective creativity of your team by starting a **Microsoft** **Teams** channel. Post requests, pull in contributors by using @mentions, and request and receive feedback on your ideas directly from the team. When you have settled on an approach, you can begin coauthoring the presentation with team members directly from the Teams channel.

## Coauthor the presentation with your team in real time

You can coauthor your presentation with team members directly from your **Microsoft Teams** channel, storing your in-process presentation and resources on the channel's Files tab for easy access. When your presentation is a **Word** document or a PowerPoint presentation, you can work online within the document at the same time as other contributors, viewing their edits in real time. You can even start a chat with a coauthor directly from the document, to discuss questions and changes.

## Create a complex presentation without relying on third-party designers

Create a professional presentation without spending all your time and budget on design. **PowerPoint** **QuickStarter** gives you research ideas and design suggestions for your chosen topic, to get your presentation started. Then you can add text, images, charts, and other content to make it your own. **PowerPoint Designer** shows you design ideas automatically when you insert an image or chart on a slide, or when you enter a list of sequential or action-oriented items. To really make an impression, use **Morph** to bring cinematic motion to your slides with one click.

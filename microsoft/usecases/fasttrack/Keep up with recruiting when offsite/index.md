Access candidate data securely when you are offsite or offline, and share and collaborate with other recruiters.


## Access recruiting documents from your mobile device

When you’re away from the office, you often still need immediate access to recruiting documents. Your company can keep its data in a collaborative workspace such as **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, and then everyone on your team can get quick and easy access to all the candidate information they need, directly from their mobile devices.

## Work offline by syncing recruiting documents to your device

You never know what connection service will be like when you’re away from the office. Stay productive while offline by creating local copies of the recruiting files you need from your **OneDrive** account, and make the changes you want—knowing that when you’re back online, all your changes will sync. When you have the OneDrive sync client installed, the conditional access control capabilities keep your recruiting documents secure in the cloud by ensuring that syncing is done only with compliant devices.

## Securely share info with candidates and hiring managers

Sometimes you need to share pertinent candidate information with external hiring managers or candidates themselves, but it can be difficult to determine which documents include too much private information. If the documents were created with **Office 365**, you can use **Azure Information Protection** to classify data based on sensitivity, encrypt your sensitive data, and define usage rights when needed, making it more secure for you to share documents both internally and externally.

## Upload recruiting documents from anywhere

Securely uploading your recruiting notes and documents to **OneDrive** or **SharePoint** is easy from almost any device. You can even upload files directly from **Outlook**. By default, files uploaded to SharePoint sites or libraries are set to Private, and files uploaded to OneDrive are not shared until you explicitly take a sharing action, so you can feel confident knowing that these newly uploaded files are safe from unauthorized viewers.

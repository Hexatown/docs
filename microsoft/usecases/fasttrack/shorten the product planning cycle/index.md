## Focus project management in one central place

When preparing for a major product launch, you can keep all of your project management channels together with **Project Online**. Project Online is web-based, which means you can work on it from anywhere. It is great for managing multiple projects, tracking work on timesheets, and balancing broad resource needs.

You can create new tasks, or set a project baseline. A project baseline can be used to compare your initial project plans, or the state of a project at certain key points as it progresses, to the current state of a project.

## Save project information in a central location

When you need to keep the team informed about the project status, you can make it easier to access project collateral by storing files in a secure, central location with **SharePoint**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Because project information is sensitive, you can customize a folder, file, or list item to broaden or limit the users who can access it and the actions they can take.

## Centralize collaboration on product development

You can brainstorm product ideas and record potential project obstacles in a shared **OneNote** notebook in an **Office 365 Group**. Office 365 Groups is a feature developed with collaboration in mind. A group includes a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events so group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get stuff done.

Every Office 365 Group comes with a connected OneNote shared notebook. Your team can use this notebook to go back and review ideas, meeting notes, and product information they've compiled together.

## Stay in touch with the project team

To accommodate unforeseen hiccups in the project schedule and keep momentum going, you can coordinate regular touchpoints using **Outlook** Calendar. Just as you write in a notebook, you can click any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type.

To help make team scheduling easier, you can add other contact's calendars to your Outlook view and see their availability side by side with yours. If your product development team already has an **Office 365 Group**, you can schedule recurring meetings using the group's shared calendar.

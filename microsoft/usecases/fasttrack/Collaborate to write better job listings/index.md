## Access requirements documents from a central location

When you're ready to put together a job listing for a new role, you can gather role requirements submitted by colleagues to your **SharePoint** site. Business groups and individuals use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a new team site with your associates to share a central library and store documentation on job duties and experience requirements by role.

## Draft a new job listing collectively

You can write a new job listing together with your colleagues by using real-time coauthoring in **Word**. First, save the document to **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, so others can work in it with you at the same time. By saving the document to the cloud, you and your colleagues can all work off the same copy and can see each other's changes as soon as they're made.

## While editing, chat with colleagues for clarification

While you're working on the new job listing, you can send an IM to your coauthors for real-time clarification without leaving the document, by using Document Conversations with **Skype for Business**. Click the Chat button to open the chat pane, and type in the box at the bottom of the pane to kick off the conversation. Everyone on your team who is working in the document will see your message and be able to respond.

## Share the finalized job listing

When you're ready to share the new job listing with hiring managers, you can prepare it for circulation with your broader team. First, you can mark the document as final in **Word** to prevent further changes. Then you can send the final document using **Outlook** Modern Attachments. When you send an attachment that is saved to the cloud, you ensure that everyone is viewing the same copy of the document. Recipients can access the attachment from virtually any device.

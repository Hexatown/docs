## Work on a report from anywhere, on any device

While out of the office, you can work on your financial analysis in **Excel** from **OneDrive** while on your mobile device. Files stored in OneDrive are automatically saved to the cloud and synced across your devices.

When you open the workbook to continue working on your financial analysis, the workbook opens in the Excel mobile app. When you return to your office computer, you can see the changes you made from your mobile device and resume your work.

## Revise the report with colleagues

When you're ready for input on the report, you can work together on the financial analysis in **Excel** in real time. Because your document is already saved in **OneDrive**, you and your colleagues can all work on the same copy and see each other's changes as soon as they're made.

## Deliver the report to the client on time

When the analysis report is ready for delivery, you can quickly and securely send it to your client as an **Outlook** attachment in the form of a link. When you send a link to a file saved to the cloud, you can ensure that everyone is viewing the same copy of the file, and you never have to worry about file size limits for email recipients. Clients can access the file from virtually any device. As you're sending, choose whether to give your client edit or just read-only permission on the report.

## Go over the details "face-to-face"

Schedule a follow-up meeting with your clients to share analysis of the report and walk through key insights in a **Skype for Business** videoconference. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You can share the report and use the whiteboard feature to capture feedback during the meeting. You and your clients can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere and on most devices.

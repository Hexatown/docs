## Quickly pinpoint the shortage

When a supply shortage is anticipated, you can quickly pinpoint where the shortage is coming from with **Power BI**. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your multiple sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. You can interact with your data using natural language in Power BI, and the dashboard will respond by changing your view based on your inquiry. Ask the dashboard what supplies are low in stock to see where your team needs to prepare for alternate solutions.

## Address the shortage with alternate suppliers

When you've identified the source of the shortage, you can immediately organize a discussion among all relevant suppliers using **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing and collaboration all one tool. You and your suppliers can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on any device.

## Draft and distribute an alternate supply plan

Once you've agreed upon an alternate solution, you can clearly summarize the new supply plan using **Office Apps**.

Start a new document from **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, so it's automatically saved to the cloud. By working on a document in the cloud, version control is automatically accounted for, and you can work on your supply plan from any device inside your Office Apps (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote.)

When you're ready to send it out, share it with suppliers using **Outlook Modern Attachments**. Outlook will recognize the cloud document as recently worked on.

## Track the alternate order progress

Once your supply chain partners have initiated the alternate supply plan, you can get real-time updates from the field through **Yammer**. Yammer is a private social network where coworkers share information across teams, and organize around projects. You can log in to Yammer from anywhere, and on any device, including your smartphone through the Yammer mobile app.

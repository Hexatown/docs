Justify your territory&apos;s value and budget by developing your own workflows, sales reports, and dashboards without burdening IT.


## Create custom apps to easily track and analyze sales data

You can create the custom sales apps you need to produce accurate and timely reports for your sales territory, without burdening your IT department. With **PowerApps**, you can use intuitive tools and pre-built templates to create what you needâ€”and never write a single line of code. Check out the sample apps in PowerApps to see if your solution is already available, or to use one as the basis for a customized app of your own. Even if you need to create an app from scratch, PowerApps makes it easy by integrating smoothly with your data in **Office 365**, **SharePoint**, and other common services.

By using **PowerApps** and **Flow**, you can access and use custom web and mobile apps with data from **SharePoint** and other sources to simplify basic processes, giving you and your team powerful tools for reporting sales.

## Transform the latest sales data from a variety of sources into visual insights

Transform sales data into rich visuals, allowing all stakeholders to easily consume and make decisions on key initiatives. With **Power BI**, you can connect data from **Office 365** apps such as **Excel**, and then choose from a huge variety of visualizations and charts. You can then share the results with your department and other colleagues via a colorful, interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Make it easy for colleagues to find sales data and files

You can use the custom apps you have created to share data stored on **SharePoint** with your team, making it easy for them to find the data they need in a timely manner. SharePoint provides both versioning and access control, so sales reps and managers can be assured that they are working with the latest information, in an environment protected with enterprise-grade security. You can store contact information in the same location, along with the tools your team needs, so no one has to spend valuable time hunting down information. Because SharePoint is fully integrated with **Office 365** desktop and mobile apps, you can store, share, and work with files any time.

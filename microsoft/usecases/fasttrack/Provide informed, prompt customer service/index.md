## Ask your coworkers on the fly

When your customers have questions, you can get immediate answers from coworkers and managers via **Skype for Business** IM and HD videoconferencing. Skype for Business is instant messaging, calling, video calling, sharing and collaboration all in one solution. You can initiate an IM chat with anyone who's listed as available—or green—in your contacts list. Or, for inquiries that call for a face-to-face meeting, you can start your video with full voice and HD.

## Store customer-facing product information in a central location

When you need to refer to product documentation to answer a customer's question, you can find customer-ready resources stored in one place on your **SharePoint**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.

A team site is designed for sharing and collaborating on files regularly, especially on files that have shared ownership—like customer-facing materials. Set up a team site with fellow customer service personnel and you will all share a central library to store your resources. Then, from any web browser, across any store, you and your coworkers can access these resources.

## Connect with product experts across the company

You can learn more about a specific product by connecting with experts on **Yammer**. Yammer is an enterprise social network where businesses share information across teams, and organize around projects. You can foster direct, free-form conversation about customer questions between sales reps and specific product experts by inviting them to a new Group and starting a conversation.

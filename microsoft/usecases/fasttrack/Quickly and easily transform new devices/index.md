Windows AutoPilot capabilities enable the quick and easy transformation of new devices into enterprise-ready machines, without imaging and with the flexibility to satisfy the needs of organizations of all shapes and sizes. This process can be done by the users themselves&#x2014;without IT ever touching the device&#x2014;when the organization uses technologies such as Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, third-party MDM services, and the Windows AutoPilot device enrollment service.


## Choose a powerful, modern device

Getting a new PC at work should be a magical experience for an employee. It shows that the company cares about making sure the employee is productive and successful. Microsoft wants that experience to truly feel rewarding and at the same time optimize results and cost for the whole company.

**Windows 10 Pro devices** offer the broadest range of innovative laptops, 2-in-1s, and portable All-in-Ones, all of which you can use like a PC. When your choice is a Windows 10 device, you can count on long-lasting batteries, faster processors, and high-resolution displays that keep you connected and productive wherever you are.

## Allow self-service deployment of new devices

For many years, organizations have deployed new versions of Windows by using a “wipe and load” deployment process. At a high level, this process captures data and settings from the existing device, deploys a custom-built Windows image to the new PC, injects hardware drivers, installs applications, and finally restores the data and settings. For most organizations, this creates significant overhead for an IT team and leads to higher help desk call volumes.

**Windows AutoPilot** enables a new PC to be easily transformed into a business-ready device without ever needing any IT assistance. The user simply unboxes and turns on the new Windows 10 device, and with just a few clicks, the device is recognized as your organization’s device and joined to Azure Active Directory, enrolled in Intune, and transformed to Windows 10 Enterprise, with the correct settings applied and Office 365 apps and line-of-business apps installed.

## Employ cloud-based mobile device management

The use of personal devices for work, in addition to the increase in the number of employees who work outside the office, is changing how organizations manage devices. Certain parts of the organization might require deep, granular control over devices, whereas other parts might seek lighter, scenario-based management that empowers the modern workforce. Windows 10 offers the flexibility to respond to these changing requirements and can easily be deployed in a mixed environment. No matter how IT decides to manage devices, Windows provides a consistent set of configurations across device form factors through a common mobile device management layer.

**Mobile device management (MDM) through Microsoft Intune** helps minimize this complexity by offering management capabilities both on-premises and in the cloud, all from a single console. **Windows 10 support for MDM** shows users what policies, settings, and apps are managed by the organization and what their status is, so end users know when their devices are ready for productive use. This reduces the number of help desk calls and allows administrators to easily troubleshoot issues. Users encounter fewer, shorter interruptions if they run into problems with mobile access to corporate resources. MDM can implement policies on devices even when users are not active, and if a device is offline or asleep, Windows can deliver policy updates when it is back online.

## Reset, repurpose, or recover a device

There are many reasons why a device might need to be reset—for instance, when the device needs to be transferred to another owner, when the device has been lost or stolen and the owner wants to remotely reset the device, when an employee leaves the organization and the organization wants to remotely reset the device, or when the device has malfunctioned and the user wants to reset the device.

**Windows Automatic Redeployment** is a mechanism that allows you to reset a fully configured device while maintaining MDM management and Azure AD connection state, and automatically get the device back into a fully configured state. This reset process preserves all the provisioning applied to the device before the reset, so that any settings, configurations, and applications can be automatically applied on the device, and the data can be restored.

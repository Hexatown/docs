## Collect input in a team communication site

As you develop your new benefits plan, you need a dedicated site where stakeholders and experts can review your drafts and provide their input. Create a **SharePoint** communication site to connect you and your team to the content, information, and apps you rely on.

## Quickly source past benefits documents from the same site

Previous benefits plans can be a great resource when you’re creating a new plan. Post your previous plans to your **SharePoint** library, and use them as the basis for a new plan. When versioning is enabled in your SharePoint library, you can store, track, and restore documents whenever they change. Libraries can track both major versions and minor versions.

## Easily access your colleagues' work by using intuitive views

When your company stores its documents in **SharePoint** or **OneDrive**, you can locate what your team is working on by using **Delve**. You can easily search for other documents a team member created by clicking that person’s name or picture.

## Instantly search for and connect with company experts

You can quickly find experts and resources on insurance plans, relevant legislation, and other possible benefits by searching in topic-related groups in your company’s **Yammer** group. Yammer allows you to share information with colleagues across teams. You can post questions to a Yammer group, and instantly tap into the expertise of everyone in the group.

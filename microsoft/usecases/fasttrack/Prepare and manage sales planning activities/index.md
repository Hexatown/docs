Bring your sales leadership, account managers, marketing managers, product specialists, and research and development contributors together in a mobile-friendly chat-based workspace to quickly coordinate your sales planning tasks.


## Set up a Sales Planning team environment

You can use **Microsoft Teams** to coordinate sales planning initiatives.

Teams provides a single place where you can have all conversations related to sales planning, and you can store and share your content and tools. Create your Sales Planning team in Teams, and then add a channel for each aspect of the work—for example, you might have team channels for the annual sales meeting, quarterly business reviews, monthly sales pipeline reviews, and your sales playbook. Then you can get the teamwork started in those channels by starting conversations, and @mention specific team members to pull them in.

## Keep track of team tasks

Whether your team is preparing for your annual sales meeting, quarterly business review, or monthly sales pipeline review, the process involves many departments throughout the company. These diverse contributors must collaborate closely to set agendas and schedules, complete presentations and brochures, and provide and update sales reports. In the appropriate **Microsoft Teams** channel, you can add a **Planner** tab to assign tasks to team members and track progress for the event. Planner helps teams easily organize their assignments and get work done in an efficient and collaborative fashion.

## Update your team on sales activity

Make sure your Sales Planning team always has the latest information based on up-to-the-minute leads and opportunities in the sales pipeline. In your **Microsoft Teams** channels, team members can easily communicate with each other regarding important information such as customer business news, customer service issues, and lead status changes.

You can add individual files, such as sales report workbooks, to a channel as tabs so team members can quickly access important data. Then you can visualize sales trends and discover insights by adding a **Power BI** dashboard to your channel. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.

## Develop sales strategies collaboratively

You can easily collaborate on the development of sales strategy tools, such as a sales playbook, by creating a conversation in a **Microsoft Teams** channel, attaching, a file, and @mentioning specific team members to pull them in. For example, team members can discuss service offerings, competitor strategies, and sales tips and advice. The file is available in the Files tab to the people in the conversation. Conversation members can review file content in the Teams window; discuss it in conversations, real-time chat sessions, or meetings; and coauthor files in Office 365 apps such as **Excel**, **PowerPoint**, and **Word**.

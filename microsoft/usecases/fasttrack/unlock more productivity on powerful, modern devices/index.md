## Comprehensive security built right in

**Windows Hello**\* is the password-free sign-in experience that gives you the fastest, most secure way to unlock your Windows devices. Windows Hello signs you in to your Windows devices in less than two seconds, three times faster than a password. Use your camera to have Windows Hello recognize your face, or try your fingerprint reader—either way, Windows Hello recognizes you instantly. You can always keep your PIN as a backup.

*Windows Hello requires specialized biometric hardware.

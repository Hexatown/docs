## Save patient files in a central location

When you need to stay informed about your patients while traveling, you can make it easier to access files by storing them in a secure, central location with **SharePoint**. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. As patient information is sensitive, you can customize a folder in a list or library, a list item, or a library file to broaden or limit which users can access the folder, list item, or library file and what those users can do to it.

## Draft an action plan for a new patient

Even when you're not at the hospital, you can evaluate an action plan for your patient by reviewing related cases with **Office Apps**. Since your patient files are stored in the cloud on your **SharePoint** site, you can access and edit your files anywhere, and from any device. Office works together with SharePoint to sync documents automatically, so when you're back at the practice, your changes have already updated in your patient files.

## Confer with patients "face-to-face"

You can maintain your bedside manner by discussing next steps with your patient with **Skype for Business** HD Videoconferencing even when you're on the go. Skype for Business is instant messaging, calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You and your patients can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere and from any device.

## Inform the team of next steps

Once your patient has given the go ahead, you can instruct your team of healthcare professionals by updating your patient care plan in the shared **OneNote** notebook that's part of your team's **Office 365 Group**. An Office 365 Group is the evolution of a distribution list. A group includes a shared workspace for email, conversations, and patient files, so group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get stuff done.

Every Office 365 Group comes with a connected OneNote shared notebook. You can use this notebook to update your patients action plan. Group members will have automatic access to your changes.

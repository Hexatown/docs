Manage your product launches for seasonal opportunities by using an intuitive team-based environment to unify your team and maximize profits.


## Easily manage product launch tasks in a shared environment

When planning a product launch, you need to quickly collect sales data from various sources. If your data isn’t in a shared environment, you have to reach out to multiple associates and locations for updates, typically by using email and voicemail. When you create a **SharePoint** team library, your entire team can organize, control, and share documents from one location. Sales reps and managers can access product launch collateral from remote locations to update sales figures. You can then use **Project Portfolio Management**, with its project management tools and **Outlook** group shared calendar, to organize teamwork, collaborate on tasks, and track progress on various initiatives.

## Manage product launches across locations by creating reports

To make sure your seasonal product launch is successful across all of your stores, you must be able to respond quickly to any issues, such as lack of product at one store and too much at another, and keep every sales associate on task and on time. **Project Portfolio Management** provides managers with the necessary tools, reports, and dashboards to easily monitor project schedules, resources, budget, and issues or risks. **Project Online** provides seamless integration with collaboration tools like **Skype for Business** and **Yammer** to help keep everyone on the same page.

## Coordinate sales reps around a product launch in a project planner

Your sales reps are busy on the sales floor. They don’t have time to learn robust project management tools, and you don’t have time to create custom reports to help them understand the needs of the launch, or their particular tasks. Use **Planner** to provide your sales reps with familiar project collaboration and conversation tools that they can access from almost anywhere, even on the sales floor, and from almost any device.

## Troubleshoot the product launch in a collaborative workspace

Your back-to-school launch date is rapidly approaching, but one sales rep had to take emergency leave, while another switched stores. You need to keep everyone on task despite these issues and any others that might crop up during a launch event. **Project Portfolio Management** offers reports and dashboards that let you see how the launch is progressing, and lets you easily reassign those tasks that are at risk. **Planner** provides virtual chat-centered workspaces that allow sales team members to easily collaborate with each other in real time, keeping your launch on time.

## Gain insight into how your team's resources are being used

Knowing how your resources are being used helps ensure your launch rolls out on time and on budget. Having the data from last year’s launch helps ensure a more efficient, and more profitiable, launch for this year. **Project Online** provides numerous, customizable sample reports to easily give you insight into how your resources are allocated across all your retail marketing and sales teams.

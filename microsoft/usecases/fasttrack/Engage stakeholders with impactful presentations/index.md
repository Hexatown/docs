Foster impactful interactions with stakeholders based on live, dynamic reports that keep up with constantly changing financial data.


## Build a report with data from multiple sources

You can showcase a wide variety of data in a meeting with stakeholders, including competitive external data with **Excel Power Query**. A query enables you to connect to, preview, and transform data from a wide variety of available data sources. You can connect to external data sources, such as Facebook and Salesforce, and import the data into your Excel workbook.

## Make the report multidimensional and interactive

Prepare for an engaging discussion with your stakeholders by transforming the report into a visual, interactive dashboard in **Power BI**. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your multiple sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. You can interact with your data using natural language in Power BI, and the dashboard will respond by changing your view based on your inquiry.

## Keep stakeholders connected from anywhere

You can provide stakeholders 24/7 access to your **Power BI dashboard** by publishing it to a shared **BI Center site**. A BI Center site is a SharePoint site that was designed especially for BI content. Stakeholders can log into the site from anywhere, on almost any device to stay up to date with their data.

## Host an impactful discussion

When it's time to meet with stakeholders, you can share and interact with your financial dashboard together through **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You can share your entire desktop with everyone in the meeting so they can see what you are seeing as you ask questions of your data and learn from the responsive visualizations.

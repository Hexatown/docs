## Check your team's availability to quickly schedule pre-event meetings

As you plan a sales event, a thousand decisions, such as the date, location, products, and staff, need to be made and communicated. You don’t have time to send email messages to all members of your sales team to poll them on when they’re available to meet. Instead of wasting your time, use **Outlook** to easily schedule a **Skype for Business** online meeting for your sales team, regardless of its size. If you're using **Exchange**, Outlook lets you see your team members' availability so you don’t have to ask and wait for a response and then ask again.

## Choose the communication tool that fits your meeting needs

You might need to train your sales staff about the products you’re showcasing at an event. **Skype for Business** is a cost-effective solution and a comprehensive multimedia platform, agile enough to fit the needs of your training meeting. If your company is set up with PSTN conferencing with Skype for Business Cloud PBX, meeting attendees can call in from their phones, right from the sales floor. Anyone you invite to your meeting can participate by using the standard Skype for Business audio, video, one-click screen sharing, and IM capabilities. You can even record meetings for people who can't attend.

## Resolve complications and build consensus faster

If you receive an email about a delayed shipment right before an event, you can use **Outlook**, with its calendar-based notifications and availability information, to quickly schedule and launch a meeting with all your department managers to find out who has product. If a product receives a stunning review during the sales event, you can communicate that to your sales staff while they are on the sales floor. You can use the IM feature in **Skype for Business** to let your sales staff know about breaking news. They can get the message right on their smartphones or tablets.

## Connect with sales reps and experts as needed, despite their location

What do you do when a sales rep at an event needs an answer for a client? What if the expert who can answer the question isn’t on the floor or even in your location? **Skype for Business** offers real-time communication solutions to enable you to find and connect with available experts by using IM, video, or voice. If your firm has set up PSTN conferencing with Skype for Business Cloud PBX, sales reps and experts can call in from their phones, even if their internet connections are unreliable or nonexistent.

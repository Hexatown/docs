Teach a class remotely without sacrificing engagement from students, while making sure they all have the necessary lesson materials wherever they are.


## Teach from a virtual classroom

You can join your students in their online classroom in **Skype for Business** from your **Outlook** calendar. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all in one tool. Use the integrated whiteboard to illustrate key concepts to your students.

From the Outlook calendar, you can schedule your recurring class sessions and join or start a Skype meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on almost any device.

## Keep students focused on the lesson plan

The default **Skype for Business** meeting options are appropriate for small and casual meetings, but for the classroom, it might be a good idea to set some preferences. You can turn off instant messaging (IM), which allows you to help students stay focused on the class content. At the same time, turning on the **Skype Q&A Manager** provides a structured environment for answering questions without distracting from the lesson plan.

## Present and annotate lesson slides

In today's class, you'll present a lecture on the U.S. Constitution. With **Skype for Business**, you can share the **PowerPoint** presentation you prepared in advance. You can call out key points by using the Skype for Business inking feature, allowing you to annotate your slides from the meeting space for everyone to see. Students can download the slide deck for further study, and control their own view of the slides as you teach.

## Summarize lesson outcomes in a shared space

For those students who missed the class, you can record the lesson you taught through **Skype for Business** and share it out. Post a link to the recording in your shared **OneNote** Class Notebook. The OneNote Class Notebook app lets a teacher quickly set up a personal workspace for every student, a content library for handouts, and a collaboration space for lessons and creative activities. The notebook is accessible to students anytime, and on almost any device.

Get together with other sales reps, no matter where they are, to get traction on your annual budget by using digital meeting solutions.


## Plan well-attended budget sessions by viewing sales team members' availability

When you need to gain consensus on a sales budget, you want to meet with your entire sales team at one time. Use **Outlook** to easily schedule an online or in-person meeting for your team, regardless of its size. If you're using **Exchange**, Outlook lets you see your team members’ availability so you can quickly find a meeting time that works for everyone—and you can even reserve a room.

## Use the best communication tool for your budget sessions

Casual IMs may be great for day-to-day chat among team members as you progress toward finalizing the budget, but for more formal, all-hands discussions you need everyone to be looking at and discussing the same page, at the same time. **Skype for Business** allows you and your team members to participate by using audio, video, one-click screen sharing, and IM capabilities. You can even record meetings for people who are unable to attend.

## Connect with your team to finalize decisions, even without an internet connection

When you need a quick decision on the final budget, you can get consensus even from team members on the road or out of the country. If your company has set up PSTN conferencing with **Skype for Business Cloud PBX**, you and your team members can call in to the meeting from their phones, even if your internet connection is unreliable or nonexistent.

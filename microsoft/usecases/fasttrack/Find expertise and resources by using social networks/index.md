Tap&#xA0;into enterprise social media to learn how to accommodate special needs in the classroom, find subject-matter experts, and other resources to improve classroom instruction.


## Engage in a district-wide dialogue

If you receive an email about a new student requiring an accessibility accommodation in the classroom, you can engage the collective knowledge of faculty across the district through **Yammer**. Yammer is a private, secure social network for your organization that allows educators to collaborate securely across departments and geographies. Start a new conversation to ask for guidance from fellow educators about the new student's requirement.

## Glean insight from fellow educators who have experience

After connecting with faculty on **Yammer**, you can query the same topic in **Delve** to identify potentially helpful presentations or resources that will assist you in preparing for your new student. Delve helps you discover information that's likely to be most interesting to you right now through the power of Office Graph. Delve shows you a mix of content from across Office 365; you’ll see both your own documents, and documents other teachers are working on. Delve never changes any permissions, so you'll only see documents that you already have access to.

## Connect with campus service personnel

If an accessibility request needs to be urgently addressed, you can reach out to campus services through **Skype for Business** to arrange for any necessary classroom equipment or modifications. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all in one solution. You can initiate an IM chat with anyone who's listed as available—or green—in your contacts list. Or, for inquiries that call for a face-to-face meeting, you can start your video with full voice and HD.

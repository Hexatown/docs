Make sure new hires get the information, training, and support needed to connect with and start contributing to the team.&#xA0;


## Easily add new hires to a team work space

Easily add new people to a team in **Microsoft Teams**, allowing them to instantly participate in group or 1:1 discussions. They can tap into the team's collective knowlege and stay updated with the latest information. Chat threads in Teams are visible to the entire team, so everyone stays in the know. When the discussion is sensitive, 1:1 and group chat ensure that the conversation and shared documents stay private to the people invited.

## Plan for an effective first week

While your new hires are ramping up, you can help them start out on the right foot using Tabs in **Microsoft Teams**. Add **Planner** to a tab, and then create a sample "first week on the job" plan. Add important internal websites in other tabs for easy reference. Encourage new hires to use chat to introduce themselves and ask questions with new colleagues and experts on the team.

## Deliver interactive onboarding sessions

Meet instantly with new hires right within a channel. In your same **Microsoft Teams** channel, meeting chat is saved in the Conversations tab to make it easy to continue and follow up on these conversations.

You can capture updates, insights, and actions from the discussion in the channel **OneNote** notebook in the Notes tab for quick reference. OneNote is a digital notebook, meaning your notes go with you, wherever you go. OneNote automatically saves and synchronizes your notes so you can focus on your thoughts and ideas.

## Connect new hires with experts and resources

Beyond your Team, you can facilitate connections between new hires to help create networks of people and information with **Delve**. Delve helps you discover information that's likely to be most interesting to you right now. Delve shows a mix of content from across Office 365; you’ll see both your own documents and documents your colleagues are working on. New hires can find people and information who may have insight to help them ramp up. Delve never changes any permissions, so you'll see only documents that you already have access to.

## Make safety training sessions virtual

If your employees are spread across various locations and even in different timezones, you can conduct safety training sessions using **Skype for Business Meeting Broadcast**. You can schedule a Broadcast for up to 10,000 attendees, who can join from any device. Add features to the session to encourage employee participation, like **Microsoft Pulse** \- where organizers like you can field questions about how the Broadcast is going. Finally, if some of your employees couldn't attend, you can record the session and share it out to bring them up to speed on the latest safety guidelines and training.

## Share procedure and guidance materials from a central location

After the Broadcast, provide 24/7 access to the training recording, resources, and guidance through a **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a site for your operations managers so you can all share a central library to store your files. Then, from any web browser, anyone who couldn't attend the Broadcast can access these important resources.

## Automate potential incident alerts

If a potential incident is at hand, you can ensure your employees are made aware using workflows in **SharePoint**.

A workflow is sometimes described as a series of tasks that produce an outcome; using the same SharePoint site where you share safety information with your employees, you can establish a workflow to push an email notification to your operations managers when an Incident-Warning form has been filled out. A workflow is always attached to exactly one SharePoint list or library. When a new Incident-Warning form is created in the library, the workflow will trigger the communication process.

## Open a cross company dialogue about safety

In the wake of a significant safety incident incurred or avoided, you can communicate with employees across the company through **Yammer**. Yammer is a private social network where coworkers share information across teams, and organize around projects. You can start a new conversation, and even loop in specific operation leads with @mentions to alert them to the thread.

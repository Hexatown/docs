Improve customer service and reduce complaints by quickly and securely accessing customer reviews, data, and company apps anywhere, anytime, on almost any device.


## Quickly get information while keeping company and customer data safe

To provide high-quality customer service, you need easy access to your company's sales apps and customer reviews—but protecting your customers' data is just as important. With **Office 365**, your company can centrally manage security policies for all productivity and customer review apps, enabling you to self-install the business apps you need to answer customer questions and address issues quickly.

When you keep your data in a collaborative workspace such as **SharePoint**, everyone on your team can get quick and easy access to all the product information they need.

## Use single sign-on across devices to easily and securely get work done

To get work done quickly, you need to be able to easily access your sales apps and your customers' data from wherever you are—on the sales floor or in the field—while still ensuring that the data remains secure. With single sign-on access to multiple devices and **Office** apps, provided by **Azure Active Directory**, you can securely launch cloud-based applications from a personalized web-based access panel or mobile app by using your company credentials. Robust mobile security features, such as mobile device management (MDM), help to ensure that you can securely work with the same app across devices.

## Create, share, and review data in real time from most devices

Coauthoring sales reports has never been easier or more secure on mobile devices. After you create a file by using any **Office 365** mobile app, you can post it to a **SharePoint** team site, and then share a link to the file for other sales associates to review. Your team can create, collect, update, and manage files. For example, when associates follow a link you send for a report written in Word, the report opens in Word or Word Online. If they agreed to automatically share changes, you see their work as it happens.

## Protect information when accessing confidential company reports

Keeping private information such as vendor contracts, sales reports, and loss prevention documentation confidential is crucial. You can be sure that all internal documents are protected when your company uses mobile device management (MDM) or **Microsoft Intune**. Intune and built-in MDM for **Office 365** are two different ways to manage mobile devices in your organization.

And, with the Office 365  Message Encryption viewer and **Exchange** ActiveSync, you can encrypt messages and block unsupported devices from accessing sent information, further protecting your customers' and your company's data.

## Rely on managed device and app security to help prevent data leakage

Mobile device management (MDM) provides industry-leading device security, so you and your customers can feel confident that information is protected through a data loss prevention (DLP) policy (set up in the **Office 365** Security & Compliance Center) that identifies, monitors, and automatically protects sensitive information.

Taking that protection one step further, if you or someone on your sales team loses a device or leaves the company, the device can be remotely wiped clean of organizational data, either selectively or completely.

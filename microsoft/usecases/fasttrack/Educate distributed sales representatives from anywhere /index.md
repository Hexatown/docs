Provide a way for distributed sales staff to attend training workshops and access product documentation from anywhere.


## Make large group training virtual

You can deliver an auditorium-style training experience with **Skype for Business Meeting Broadcast**. Schedule a Broadcast for up to 10,000 attendees, who can join from anywhere, and on almost any device. Add features to the session to encourage attendee participation, like **Microsoft Pulse**—where organizers like you can field questions about how the Broadcast is going. Finally, if some of your sales representatives can't attend, you can record the session and share it to bring them up to speed.

## Share training resources in a central location

After the Broadcast, you can make the training files—as well as the recording—available to all of your sales representatives on a **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a team site with your salesforce so you can all share a central library to store your files. Then, from any web browser, anyone who couldn't attend the Broadcast can access these resources.

## Build a digital employee handbook

You can further inform your salesforce by creating and sharing a **OneNote** notebook dedicated to product and sales guidance and best practices. OneNote is a digital notebook, meaning your notes go with you, wherever you go. You can create a notebook with separate pages for specific department training, and update it as job requirements change.

## Engage in conversation with colleagues

To keep the conversation going, you can use Yammer to enable your sales staff to educate one another by sharing best practices, asking questions, and polling ideas. Yammer is a private social network where businesses share information across teams and organize around projects. Only your coworkers can join, so your communications are secure and visible only to people within your organization.

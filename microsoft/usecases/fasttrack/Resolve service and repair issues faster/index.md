Shorten resolution time in the field&#xA0;by easily accessing equipment repair information and to product experts.


## Share and store service guidance in a central location

You can find visual manuals, equipment history, and repair tips faster by storing files and searching the knowledge base in a **SharePoint** portal. Organizations use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. When your team has set up a team site for service personnel, everyone can share a central document library and access these resources from any web browser, from any field location.

## Uncover useful repair tips from colleagues who have experience

Leverage the knowledge of your service network by using **Delve** to uncover relevant content that coworkers have worked on. Delve helps you discover information that's likely to be most interesting to you right now through the power of the **Office Graph**. Find personnel who may have answers to a service issue by searching for a specific product or subject. Delve never changes any permissions, so you'll only see documents that you already have access to.

## Find information and answers from experts across the company

When you are having trouble pinning down a solution to an unusual repair problem, you can crowd-source answers with the help of experts in your company by using **Yammer**. Yammer is a private, secure social network for your organization that allows people to collaborate securely across departments and geographies. You can join a conversation, or start a new thread about a specific service issue.

## Inform customers of resumed service

When the repair has been completed, you can inform your customers quickly by using **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration in one tool. You and your colleagues can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on any device.

Make patient and hospital data accessible to mobile staff while keeping that data more secure with appropriate permissions, policies, and access management.


## Securely access clinic or hospital apps and data from your device

You need to be able to access your healthcare organization's email, data, and apps even when you are offsite. However, you also need to ensure that this data is secure. When your organization uses **Enterprise Mobility + Security** and **Azure Active Directory**, you can use your credentials to access the information and tools you need, knowing that your data is protected. Your administrator can allow or block access or challenge users with Multi-Factor Authentication, and they can enforce device enrollment or password change to add layers of protection.

## Classify and encrypt patient records based on their sensitivity

Sometimes you need to share patient information or hospital data with specialists. But it can be difficult to determine which documents include too much private hospital information or identifying patient data. With **Azure Information Protection**, your organization can classify data based on sensitivity and add labels manually or automatically, encrypt your sensitive data and define usage rights when needed, and apply protection easily without interrupting your team's normal course of work.

## Connect with other clinicians securely by using encrypted messaging

**Office 365** provides you with multiple layers and kinds of encryption, all of which work together to secure your data where it resides and when it is in transit. When your company's email server is hosted through Office 365 and **Exchange Online**, you can feel comfortable knowing that your communications are protected with **Office Message Encryption** and **Information Rights Management**.

## Protect hospital and patient data with document security policies

The information you collect from each patient is crucial to that patient's health and care, but it must be protected. This includes making sure it is stored securely. To help with this, your organization can use the data governance features in **Office 365**. With these features enabled, your organization can manage the full content lifecycle, from importing and storing data at the beginning, to creating policies that retain and then permanently delete content at the end.

## Protect data even if clinic devices are lost or stolen

When your company subscribes to **Office 365**, you can manage and secure your mobile device, such as your smartphone or tablet, by enrolling it in mobile device management (MDM) for Office 365. MDM for Office 365 can be used to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices—fully or selectively—if they're lost or stolen.

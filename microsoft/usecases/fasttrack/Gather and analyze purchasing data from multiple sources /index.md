Collect historic sales data from internal and external sources and analyze it without having to learn complex coding.


## Pull sales data from a central database

When you need to interact with your sales data in a meaningful way, you can work with information from multiple sources in **Excel**. Perhaps your organization uses a central **SharePoint** site to store and manage information. You can pull store-by-store sales data into Excel from a SharePoint list on your site, or from a text file stored in the site document library to start a new workbook.

Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. As sales data is sensitive, you can customize a folder in a list or library, a list item, or a library file to broaden or limit which users can access the folder, list item, or library file and what those users can do to it.

## Compare industry sales figures with internal data

If you want to see how competitive sales data measures in comparison to your own, you can do so with **Excel** Power Query. A query enables you to connect to, preview, and transform data from a wide variety of available data sources. You can connect to industry-wide data sources from the web and import that data into your Excel workbook.

## Shape and share sales insights

You can mine even deeper insights about your sales data by creating an interactive **Power BI** dashboard. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your multiple sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. It can be your personal report and visualization tool, and can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.

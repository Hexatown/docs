## Create visually appealing presentations using professional templates

You can easily create professional-looking digital marketing materials that showcase your company’s products without the help of a design team. Start with a **PowerPoint** template or theme that uses visually appealing combinations of colors, images, and text elements. To ensure the consistent appearance of digital marketing materials, you can create a custom template or theme that incorporates your company’s colors, fonts, and imagery.

## Discover and reuse existing content from across your organization

To populate your presentation, use the intelligent search features of **Delve** to find relevant marketing content, trend information, and sales data from across your organization. Add the documents, workbooks, and presentations you find to a Delve board so you can easily return to them.

## Enhance slide content with icons

**PowerPoint** provides an extensive library of icons representing concepts related to people, apparel, communication, business, commerce, technology, and many other topics. The icons area includes scalable vector graphics (SVG files) so you can easily resize and recolor them to match the content of your look book presentation.

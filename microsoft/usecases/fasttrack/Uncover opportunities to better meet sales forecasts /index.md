Gather customer feedback and analyze buying behavior to evaluate opportunities to better meet sales forecasts.


## Get feedback from your customers

To learn more about customer buying behaviors straight from the source, you can invite customers to share their product feedback with your team through **Yammer**. Yammer is a private social network where businesses share information across teams, and organize around projects.

Yammer now allows you to create a group that includes external users. External  groups will look different than regular Yammer groups, so you can easily distinguish which groups have external participants.

## Gain insight into customer pain points by tapping into the expertise of customer service representatives

To ensure you’re getting the full picture, you can further uncover customer expectations through a discussion with service personnel through **Skype for Business**. You can initiate an IM chat with anyone who's listed as available - or green - in your contacts list. Or, for inquiries that call for a face-to-face meeting, you can start a video call with full voice and HD.

## Assess feedback against hard sales data

When you're ready to see how customer feedback sizes up against your sales data, you can pull in and combine sales data for analysis into **Excel** with Power Query. A query enables you to connect to, preview, and transform data from a wide variety of available data sources. You can even connect to external sales data sources from the web and import the data into your Excel workbook.

To create a query in Excel 2016, from the Data tab on the ribbon, select the New Query button in the Get & Transform group.

## Visualize customer and sales trends

You can analyze and visualize your data for ways to better meet sales forecasts by using **Power BI.** Business intelligence (BI) is essentially a set of tools and processes that businesses use to gather data, turn it into meaningful information, and then make better decisions.

In order for Power BI to import data from your **Excel** workbook, that data needs to be formatted as a table. It's easy. In Excel, you can highlight a range of cells, and then on the Insert tab of the Excel ribbon, click Table.

## Walk through purchasing forecasts with suppliers "face-to-face"

You can illustrate purchasing needs with graphs depicting seasonal sales fluctuations using desktop sharing and HD videoconferencing from **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing and collaboration all in one solution. You and your suppliers can join or start a meeting with just one click, from anywhere, and on any device.

## Collect bids from multiple suppliers in one location

When you're making a decision about which supplier to use for a purchase order, you can collect bids orderly and securely via a permission protected **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.

You can associate a specific supplier bid template with a document library, which is a location on a SharePoint site where you can create, collect, update, and manage files with other people in or outside your organization. Share this template with your suppliers to collect bids in one central place.

## Send purchase orders quickly and securely

When you're ready to send out a new purchase order, you can do so quickly with **Outlook** Modern Attachments. First, save the new order as a read-only protected file stored in **OneDrive**, locking it from any edits from your suppliers.

When you send an attachment that's saved to the cloud, you ensure everyone is viewing the same copy of the document. Outlook Modern Attachments will recognize the file as recently worked on, saving you time and decreasing confusion.

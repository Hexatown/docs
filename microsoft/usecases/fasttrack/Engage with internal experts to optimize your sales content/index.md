Move prospects through the sales funnel by working with your company&apos;s product and customer experts to craft compelling, focused sales content.


## Connect with company experts to create better sales content

Your company's experts can help you better engage target customers by contributing valuable input to your sales materials. Start by bringing your sales team together in a **Yammer** group dedicated to your sales initiative. Then pull in known experts with @mentions, and share documents with the group directly from the Yammer conversation to start generating content that will help you win more sales.

## Store sales content in one location to facilitate team contribution

When you store your in-process sales content on a shared site such as **SharePoint**, you can invite experts to contribute in a single document, saving time and avoiding version control issues. By adding a **Yammer** feed to your SharePoint site, you can bring the discussion about the content and target audience to the forefront of the group's attention, keeping everyone up to date and inviting input and feedback.

Delve presents personalized content based on your interests and search terms, connecting you quickly with the content you need.

## Enable remote experts to securely collaborate from their devices

Whether your company's product and audience experts are across the hall or across the world, you can bring them in with the mobile capabilities of **Yammer**. Experts in the field or out of the office can connect to the Yammer group from their Android, iOS, or Windows devices at any time, overcoming the distance and time-zone challenges of a geographically dispersed team.

Respond promptly to health and care questions raised by patients by easily accessing medical information and connecting with other health professionals.


## Review a patient's medical file

When faced with an ad hoc patient question, you can review their medical history in your hospital's central **SharePoint** site. Organizations use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. As patient records are sensitive files, your practice can customize a folder in a list or library to broaden or limit which users can access the folder and what those users can do to it.

## Seek advice from colleagues

After reviewing the patient's file, you can ask for advice on your treatment plan from available team members with **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging, calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You can tell if a colleague is available for an IM chat or call through different presence indicators. Green means go!

## Take notes for the patient's record

After talking with your colleagues, you can make quick notes about your patient's medical care from anywhere in **OneNote**. OneNote is a digital notebook, meaning your notes go with you, wherever you go. OneNote automatically saves and synchronizes your notes so you can focus on getting back to your patient with answers. Later, you can move your notes to the patient’s chart.

## Reply to the patient with next steps

Once you're ready, you can answer your patient's questions by sharing an updated treatment plan with **Outlook** Modern Attachments. Because your patient's medical file is stored in **SharePoint** in the cloud, Outlook will easily recognize the treatment plan as a recently worked on document. You also are ensuring you and your patient are viewing the same copy of the document.

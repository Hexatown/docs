Track progress in filling open positions, and the status of all candidates, in a way that teams can monitor and update in real time.


## Monitor all applicants for an open position

When filling open positions, you can easily track candidates for specific job roles in **Excel**. With Excel, you can create a simple workbook by using a template, add data by typing in a worksheet, create basic charts, and get help with tasks. You can keep your candidate contact and qualification information in one workbook, accessible from any device.

## Share and update the candidate list with colleagues

If your broader team is also involved in interviews, you can publish your **Excel** workbook as a **SharePoint** list. Working with SharePoint lists can be easier for viewing and editing data together on an ongoing basis. Start inside the table you want to export and click Design > Export > Export Table to SharePoint List.

## Check in with candidates face-to-face

As you conduct interviews, you can check in with candidates via **Skype for Business**. Skype for Business is instant messaging (IM), calling, video calling, sharing, and collaboration all rolled into one solution. You can initiate an IM chat with anyone who's listed as available—or green—in your contacts list. Or, for conversations that call for a face-to-face meeting, you can start your video with full voice and HD.

## Send official job offers securely

When you've found the perfect candidate, you can send offers securely by using **Outlook Modern Attachments**. When you send files that are stored in the cloud, you save time and eliminate confusion by sharing one copy of the document with your recipient. As you're sending, choose whether to allow your new potential hire edit or just read-only permission on the job offer.

Collaboration is how work gets done. When we look at how companies are working today, we see a myriad of tools in use, and a variety of work cultures, across geographies and generations.&#xA0;
We&#x2019;ve designed Office 365 to meet the unique needs of every group. Together, the product suite creates a holistic collaboration solution.


## Which tool is right for your group?

Choose the right collaboration tool for your group.

*   Spend most of your time in email? Use groups in Outlook for email-based collaboration.
*   Need to connect across the organization to share best practices or participate in all company discussions? Use Yammer, the social network for work, to create communities of interest.
*   Engaged in high velocity teamwork? Use Microsoft Teams, the chat-based workspace.
*   Want to make calls and hold online meetings? Use Skype for Business for voice and video meetings on any device.
*   Need to store and share team files? Use SharePoint for file collaboration and intranet sites.

Use automated tools to streamline the process of gathering and transforming data so that you can spend more time on working on financial analysis and driving impact.


## Use automated tools to ease the pain of manual data gathering

The routine tasks of gathering and updating financial data can take up time that could be better spent communicating with your stakeholders or focusing on strategic analysis. Streamline data gathering for analysis and reporting by using automated tools in **Excel**. With Get & Transform, you can import data from a wide variety of sources such as databases, Microsoft Azure, or numerous external sources. For quick data gathering from internal sources such as **SharePoint**, create a targeted **PowerApp** to quickly find just the data you need.

## Quickly gather external data from common sources

Whether you’re working on a client prospectus, quarterly report or forecasting the ROI of a new initiative, you may need to collect data from a third-party online service such as Facebook or Salesforce. You can easily gather the data you need right from within **Excel**, by using Excel's Get & Transform (Power Query) experience. You can then use the Query Editor to edit query steps to shape or transform data.

## Keep data up to date by storing it in a secure, shared location

When you need to quickly find and analyze data for a client or stakeholder, you need to be confident that the data is current. This can be a challenge when others are working with the same files. To ensure that everyone is working with the same information, keep your analysis in a single (or team or consolidated) file shared with your colleagues on your **SharePoint** team site. This file can serve as a single source of truth for your team’s analysis and protects it with the industry-leading privacy and security features built into SharePoint.

## Speed up complex analysis by using advanced analytics

Use advanced analytics in **Excel** to get the data analysis results you need quickly and easily. After using Get & Transform (Power Query) to prepare your data, create a data model and use PowerPivot to manipulate your data, create relationships, develop forecasts, and perform hundreds of advanced calculations with ease.

## Share your data with stakeholders in an interactive dashboard

Transform your data into rich visuals, allowing all stakeholders to easily consume the results and make decisions on key initiatives. With **Power BI**, you can connect data from **Office 365** apps such as Excel, and then choose from a huge variety of visualizations and charts. You can then share the results with your department and other colleagues via a colorful, interactive Power BI dashboard.

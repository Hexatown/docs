Bring the whole medical team together to securely create the optimal care plan for your patient.


## Collect the patient's records in a secure, accessible location

To create an effective care plan for your patient, start by gathering everything—patient history, lab results, clinician notes, and more—in one secure location. Create a channel in **Microsoft Teams** for the care plan, and then add the patient’s documents to the channel’s Files tab, where you and other team members can securely access them from the channel’s **OneDrive**.

## Work with everyone to keep the records up to date

When your patient’s records are stored in **Microsoft Teams**, everyone on the team can refer to and edit the records whenever they have an update. If you or another team member has a question. you can open a focused conversation with the medical team right in Teams. If the documents were created with **Office 365** apps such as **Word**, everyone can work on the same document at the same time.

## Meet online to make care decisions

When it’s time to discuss the next steps in the patient’s case, you can get everyone together in a real-time meeting in **Microsoft Teams** to review the care plan and make decisions, even if some team members are offsite. Use an audio or video call from within Teams, and share the document or screen to make whole-team decisions quickly and efficiently.

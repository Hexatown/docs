Speed up your data-gathering, analysis, and reporting processes with customized tools you can access from almost any device.


## Build your own data-mining tool

When you need to quickly access up-to-the-minute financial data for analysis and reporting from sources such as spreadsheets, databases, web services, or data feeds, you can create a customized **PowerApp** that taps into exactly the data you're looking for. PowerApps present data in an easy-to-use format that lets you search, sort, and filter data with a single click, so you can quickly surface the information you need.

## Use formulas to create a custom data-analysis app

Whether you are an investment analyst, a financial manager, or an accountant, you probably have a familiar set of formulas that you find yourself running over and over again. You can streamline this recurring data-analysis process by setting up a **PowerApp** that runs one or more formulas for you, on the data you choose, with just a few clicks. PowerApps can work with dozens of common fomulas—from simple text formatting to complex mathematical functions—to transform your data quickly and accurately.

## Eliminate redundancy by automating reporting tasks

Reporting is a vital function of any financial role, but often the tasks involved in creating a report are tedious and repetitive, taking up time that could better be spent elsewhere. When the data for your report resides in **SharePoint**, however, you can use a powerful set of tools that takes these redundant but important tasks off your shoulders. Because SharePoint is integrated with **PowerApps**, **Power BI**, and **Microsoft Flow**, you can easily set up apps and workflows to automate and streamline dozens of common business processes, including reporting.

## Connect from wherever you are with mobile custom apps

When you have your data-mining, analysis, and report-generating apps in place, you can access them from wherever you are, because apps built using **PowerApps** can run on Windows, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, or in a web browser. Apps running on a mobile device can take advantage of the device's capabilities, such as location and camera. You can download PowerApps Mobile from the Windows Store, the App Store, or Google Play.

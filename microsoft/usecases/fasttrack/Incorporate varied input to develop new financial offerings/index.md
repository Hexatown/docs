Gather productive input from all relevant stakeholders to better understand client needs and expectations.


## Collect input from stakeholders

When you're developing a proposal for a new financial offering, such as a fund, you can collect insights from your colleagues by creating a dedicated **Office 365** group of fund analysts and advisors. Office Groups is a feature developed with collaboration in mind. A group includes a shared **SharePoint** workspace so you can gather all relevant material in one convenient location that the entire team can access.

## Share new proposals with the team

You can share new proposals and ideas with the stakeholders in your Office 365 group through a **SharePoint** team site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device, which ensures that your team can easily find and access the information while keeping it private to your group. Some information is sensitive, so you can customize SharePoint settings to broaden or limit which users can access the information.

## Collaborate on proposals and supporting documents on the fly

With **Skype for Business**, you can view presence indicators to quickly see who is available right now to collaborate on the proposal. You can share your entire desktop with everyone in the meeting so they can see what you are seeing. Because you’ve saved your proposal to the group’s **SharePoint** team site, you can work collaboratively by using **Office 365** and Skype for Business together by coauthoring while in a meeting or conversation. Everyone in the coauthoring session will be able to see changes being made to the document in real time.

## Send the finished proposal to the investors

When you and your colleagues are happy with the final proposal, you can send the proposal to investors for their response by using **Outlook** attachments in the form of a link. When you send a link to a file that's saved to the cloud, you ensure that everyone is viewing the same copy of the document. Recipients can access the attachment from virtually any device. As you're sending, choose whether to allow your investors edit or just read-only permission on the proposal.

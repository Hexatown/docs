Leverage company-wide experience to capture best practices and share them across&#xA0;the organization.


## Store and share guidance in a central location

Find handbooks and system guides in one place by storing resources on your **SharePoint **site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device. Set up a team site with fellow sales representatives so you can all share a central library to store your resources.

## Glean knowledge from colleagues who have experience

Tap into the collective knowledge of those around you with tailored content from**Delve**. Delve helps you discover information that's likely to be most interesting to you right now. Your department can use a Delve Board to surface and share related documents. For example, you can create a Board about department success stories. Boards are open to everyone in your organization, but if a Board has documents that require specific access, only content you are allowed to see will surface.

## Connect with experts across departments

You can extend your exposure to best practices outside your team and focus area by connecting to new experts across the organization on **Yammer**. Yammer is a private, secure social network for your organization that allows people to collaborate securely across departments and geographies.

## Build a best practices playbook

Compile and share best practices you find useful in a **OneNote** notebook. Because OneNote notebooks are digital notebooks, your notes go with you wherever you go. OneNote automatically saves and synchronizes your notes so you can focus on your thoughts and ideas.

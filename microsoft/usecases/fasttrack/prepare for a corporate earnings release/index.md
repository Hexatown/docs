## Set up an Earnings Release team environment

You can use **Microsoft Teams** to prepare for a corporate earnings release.

Create your Earnings Release team in Microsoft Teams, and then add a channel for each activity—for example, you might have channels for the annual report, the earnings call, securities commission filings, and general program management. Then you can get the teamwork started in those channels by starting conversations, and @mention specific team members to pull them in.

Team members can access conversations online in **Office 365**, or in the desktop or mobile [Microsoft Teams app](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads "Microsoft Teams app").

## Collaboratively create an annual report

You can easily work on annual reports, set context, and share relevant financial data from within **Microsoft Teams**. Add files to a channel's Files tab, where everyone on your team can work on them using familiar Office 365 apps, such as **Excel**, **PowerPoint**, and **Word**. Team members can work on these documents on their computers or mobile devices.

## Manage data and deadlines for securities commission filings

Create a Securities Commission Filing channel in **Microsoft Teams** to focus on the activities associated with mandatory securities commission filings, such as the collection of financial data and audits, and preparation of the forms and reports to be submitted. You can track the tasks and assignments by adding a **Planner** tab to your channel, and use the Files tab to provide team members with the documents they need to complete those tasks, such as financial data tables, securities commission filings from previous years, report templates, and filing deadlines.

## Prepare for a corporate earnings call

Prepare for your company's earnings call by bringing everyone together in a **Microsoft Teams** channel. Team members can use the channel to produce and review the earnings call slide deck, the call script, and the question-and-answer document, all from within Teams.

You can also collaborate on schedules and invitations, press releases, and other important files. Finally, you can use **Skype for Business**, with its meeting presentation and recording features, to conduct the call itself.

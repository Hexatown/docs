## Analyze market data from multiple sources

To correctly analyze trends in the markets you're tracking, you need quick, accurate access to the relevant data, either from within your company or from external sources. You can discover, refine, and combine external data with internal data sets by using **Excel** Power Query. A query enables you to connect to, preview, and transform data from a wide variety of available data sources, like Facebook or Salesforce, and import the data into your Excel workbook.

After you gather all your data, you can share the information in an interactive **Power BI** market trend visualization. In the Power BI dashboard, you can show your colleagues a 360-degree view of the most important metrics in one place, updated in real time, and available on almost any device.

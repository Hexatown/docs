Quickly find and share tips, tricks, and best practices with your coworkers.


## Instantly share best practices within your team

Firstline workers are uniquely qualified to notice opportunities for improving customer experiences and increasing the company's success. Is there a quicker way to stock products? A sure-fire phrase to promote a new menu item? A more efficient method of getting an expert answer to a customer's question? Firstline workers can share tips and photos with their team instantly via real-time chat in **StaffHub**. If the tip stands the test of time, supervisors can add the information to StaffHub Team Files to share it more permanently with the entire workforce.

## Share best practices with your whole organization

You can extend your exposure to best practices outside your team and focus area by connecting to everyone in the organization on **Yammer**. Yammer is a private, secure social network for your organization that allows people to collaborate securely across departments and geographies.

## Store and share guidance in a central location

Supervisors can make process documentation, handbooks, and best practices easy for firstline workers to find by storing them in one place on the company's **SharePoint** site. Businesses use SharePoint sites as a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information, from almost any device.  For companies in which workers operate in different roles and departments, SharePoint can host team sites, so that each team can share a central library for resources focused on their own processes and goals.

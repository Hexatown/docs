Scale your school district&apos;s math classes to meet student needs by identifying and engaging with curriculum and departmental experts, and learning from best practices.


## Capture ideas and best practices from teachers and administrators

Scaling a class across a school district requires the input of many contributors. To save time routing information and make sure everyone can post and find curriculum data, best practices, and other documents for the proposal, you need a centralized, secure location that everyone can access. With **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, individual contributors can store their own work files and proposal-related documents in a centralized, secure location. Use version history if you need to refer to or restore a previous version of a document.

## Connect with school leaders to find the right content

It takes some brainstorming and lot of collaboration to come up with a proposal that adequately addresses the needs of the students. Post a question to a **Yammer** group to bring math department heads and school administrators into the conversation in real time, from wherever they are. Yammer can connect you to people in your district with the knowledge and guidance you need to create the curriculum changes that will ensure your students’ success.

## Quickly find the curriculum information you need

When you have gathered relevant math curriculum and lesson plans from across the school district in **OneDrive** or **SharePoint**, you can quickly locate what you need by using **Delve**. By surfacing content that is personalized to you and your district, Delve allows you to see at a glance what each of your colleagues is working on, including documents that are shared as email attachments. Delve never changes any permissions, so you’ll only see documents that you already have access to.

## Surface resources that provide new perspectives or findings to your project

Eliminate the learning curve when preparing your class scaling proposal by locating and collaborating with the right internal experts. Post a question to a **Yammer** group to bring others into the conversation in real time. Yammer can connect you to teachers, administrators, and other experts with the knowledge and guidance you need to create the proposal. If you're using **Delve** to surface content, you can click a document’s content card to instantly add it to a Yammer group, and get the conversation going!

## Collaborate with stakeholders and experts from wherever they are

In addition to allowing you to connect with stakeholders and experts across the school district, the **Yammer** enterprise social network makes it easy for you to share files and get feedback in real time. You can provide easy access to the files your contributors need right from the team’s Yammer workspace. Better yet, everyone in your Yammer group has direct access from their Android, iOS, or Windows device, any time they need it. They can even use Yammer's Search and Discovery features to quickly search previous or current Yammer conversations.

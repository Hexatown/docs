Spark innovation and solve problems more quickly by tapping into your entire workforce, from factory employees to executives, across the globe.


## Drive innovation by engaging and empowering factory workers

Factory workers and supervisors know the company's front line best, but there is often a gap between this rich source of information and the people who make the decisions. You can bridge this gap by connecting everyone with the **Yammer** social network. In a Yammer group, firstline workers can participate in conversations with engineers, sales reps, and executives to contribute ideas for new products or processes, and to comment on proposed initiatives. Product groups can tap these contributors by posting new product videos and prompting discussions about them on Yammer.

## Focus globally dispersed employees on companywide goals

Any organization with a global workforce must figure out how to ensure that everyone is working toward the same goals. **Yammer** not only unites employees from the factory floor to the executive suite, but also bridges the divide between employees across geographies. Yammer Message Translation facilitates real-time conversations in multiple languages, and its integration with **Office 365** provides enterprise-grade security for knowledge transfer. For example, decision-makers can provide data analytics to every employee in the company, allowing each employee to focus on their own plant's top 10 customers and its performance against quality goals.

## Securely collaborate with integrated tools

Quickly gather ideas for new products and processes, and collaborate on their development, by using **Office 365**. You can use Office 365's secure, enterprise-ready collaboration tools across your organization to streamline the progress from idea to production. Because **Yammer** is integrated with Office 365, you can move directly from conversation to collaboration with familiar tools such as Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, and you can store working files securely in **SharePoint** for anyone in the group to access. Yammer's external groups also allow you to engage strategic suppliers without exposing the company's intellectual property.

## Reach solutions more quickly with mobile connectivity

Employees on the factory floor are often not connected to the rest of the company by computer workstations. **Office 365**'s mobile apps can engage this difficult-to-reach segment by providing secure, familiar productivity and communication tools that they can access from their mobile devices. For example, a factory supervisor who encounters an equipment problem can escalate it to the central office in another country through **Yammer** for quick problem resolution. With Yammer, employees can also reach out for answers from the company's technicians all over the globe who have faced a similar issue.

## Enable secure knowledge transfer across your company

One of the challenges every company faces is keeping everyone updated on important information such as new training, equipment updates, and outages. **Office 365** provides a suite of tools and solutions that makes it easy to store, share, and transfer knowledge securely and swiftly throughout your company. You can use **SharePoint** to provide employees with access to customer profiles, product specs, best practices, and much more, all protected with enterprise-grade information rights management. You can also create a **Yammer** new hire group to welcome newcomers and link them with mentoring, training, and knowledge resources.

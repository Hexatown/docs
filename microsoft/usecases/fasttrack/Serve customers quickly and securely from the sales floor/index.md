Answer customer questions and close sales right from the sales floor with confidence by using your Microsoft 365 powered device and your store&apos;s integrated apps.


## Complete customer orders directly from your device

When you greet customers on the sales floor with a **Windows** device in your hands, you can check stock and complete orders in minutes. No more running back to check on inventory or fighting the bottleneck at the cash register to complete a transaction. **Windows 10** devices include industry-leading security, diversity in form factors, and integration with Office 365, so you can be sure your mobile interactions with your customers are productive and secure.

## Share best practices to build a customer-centric culture

Firstline workers are uniquely qualified to notice opportunities for improving the customer experience. Is there a quicker way to stock products? A sure-fire phrase to promote a new menu item? A more efficient method of getting an expert answer to a customer's question? You can share tips and photos with your coworkers instantly via real-time chat on your mobile device with **StaffHub**. If the tip stands the test of time, supervisors can add the information to StaffHub Team Files to share it more permanently with the entire workforce.

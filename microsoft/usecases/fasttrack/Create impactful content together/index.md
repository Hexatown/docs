With Office, you can get things done from virtually anywhere, faster. You can take advantage of the Office integration with OneDrive and SharePoint to access, share, and coauthor documents. You can also download Office Mobile apps to help you access everything you need to work seamlessly from nearly any device while you re on the move.


## Get more done from anywhere, on any device

The Office Mobile apps—Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile, and OneNote—are built from the ground up for touch, offer the familiar experience that Office customers expect, and deliver the capabilities people need for on-the-go productivity.

You're out of the office and need an important file. With OneDrive, you can open and edit Office files across your devices using Office apps or a browser. Your work will save automatically. If you work offline, changes will synchronize to OneDrive as soon as you reconnect.

## Work seamlessly with colleagues

Real-time coauthoring lets you and your colleagues edit the same document at the same time, so you can see what others are editing as they type. Office apps provide tools such as commenting and change tracking, and activities for communication, clarity, and consistency.

When you're using Office and your document is on SharePoint or OneDrive, when everyone is done, you have a finished document, there's no need to copy and reformat. When you're working together, you can see where everyone is and what they're typing—as though they're typing on your device.

## Quickly find and use important content when you need it, where you need it

Tap for Word and Outlook instantly surfaces existing content directly within your document or email message, without leaving the app. This allows you to keep your focus on the content you’re creating rather than searching for information in other files.

Tap surfaces relevant files most frequently used by you and shared by your coworkers. It recommends personalized content from Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and displays it in the Tap pane. You can pull content from the Tap pane into your working document or email message and start building your message. If what you are looking for wasn't surfaced, you can search for what you need from within the Tap pane.

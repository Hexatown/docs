title: Standard users and roles
---

All are prefix XA - short for heXA - the XA prefix ensures that the names will be placed low in any address lists, but not last. Hence making it harder for any one to discover and get confused by the names.

- All are prefixed "xa-"
- All administrative accounts are suffixed "-admin"
- All administrative roles  are suffixed "-admins"

```javascript
<script>
users = [{name : "xa-global-admin", displayname = "XA GLOBAL ADMINISTRATOR"}]

Outlook Tasks was a part of Outlook Calendar (originally called Calendar in Outlook.com) as a view. Since then, Microsoft has separated the services into its own web app in Outlook on the web. In a post on the Office Blogs in 2015, Microsoft announced that Outlook Web App would be renamed Outlook on the web and that Tasks would move under that brand. A user can create tasks, put them into categories, and move them to another folder. A feature added was the ability to set due days and sort and filter the tasks according to those criteria. Outlook Tasks provides the user with fields such as subject, start and end dates, percent complete, priority, and how much work was put into each task. Rich editing features like bold, italic, underline, numbering, and bullet points were also introduced. Tasks can be edited and categorized according to how the user wishes them to be sorted.[10]

## History
Outlook Tasks was originally launched as Tasks for Outlook Web App. Microsoft is slowly rolling out a preview of Outlook Tasks to its consumer-based Outlook.com service that in May 2015, was announced to be moving to the Office 365 infrastructure.[11] Outlook Tasks was originally a view in Calendar as part of Outlook.com.

## Features

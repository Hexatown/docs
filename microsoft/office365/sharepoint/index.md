*SharePoint Online* (SPO) is the cloud version of [[SharePoint]] and the major enterprise content management tool that comes as part of Microsoft’s Office 365 suite of software. SPO provides document and data management tools along with a [http://icsh.pt/HowToSPSearch built-in search engine]. SPO is hosted and maintained by Microsoft on its servers. 

SPO is organized by sites, lists, and items. SPO sites are generally used to create intranets and manage team collaboration. SPO integrates fully with [Office Online](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/word-online-service-description.aspx), the web-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, which all support [http://icsh.pt/CoAuthoring co-authoring] (simultaneous editing) by multiple users.

SPO provides similar functionality to earlier, [[on-premises]] versions of SharePoint. SPO is most similar in functionality to [[SharePoint 2016]], though as time goes on this becomes less true as more features are introduced to SPO on an on-going basis.

## History
SPO is the cloud version of the former on-premises version of SharePoint, with versions that date back to 2001. SPO is updated and upgraded by Microsoft regularly, with features added and deprecated based on SPO users’ needs. 

## Accessing
SPO is part of most of the O365 subscription services for enterprises. Accessing SPO is easy and can be accomplished on any device with an internet connection. Unless your organization has instituted a VPN, you should be able to log in to your organization's SPO [[tenant]] by browsing to <code>https://office.com</code>, logging in with your organization-specific [[credential]]s, and selecting SharePoint from the O365 [[waffle]].

## Features
SPO is organized by sites and site collections. Sites can have child and grandchild sites to create a tree or family of sites. There are multiple types of sites and [https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Using-templates-to-create-different-kinds-of-SharePoint-sites-449eccec-ff99-4cf3-b62e-dcfee37e8da4 site templates].

Sites provide lists and [http://icsh.pt/SPDocLibs document libraries], which can be used to organize data and files in a strategic way. SPO provides multiple list templates, including [http://icsh.pt/SPCalendars calendars], task lists, contact lists, [http://icsh.pt/SPSurveyIntro surveys], and more. Document libraries provide [http://icsh.pt/VersionHistory version history], [http://icsh.pt/CoAuthoring co-authoring], [http://icsh.pt/MetadataGuide metadata], and the ability to [http://sharepointmaven.com/solve-sharepoint-sync-issues-using-new-onedrive-sync-client/ sync files locally] (on your computer or mobile device) for offline use.

SPO can be a powerful tool out-of-the-box and can also be customized to provide higher-order solutions for specific customers. For example, complex [http://sharepointmaven.com/2-ways-to-design-sharepoint-taxonomy-for-an-organization/ taxonomies] can be used to organize content and improve search, [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262735.aspx content types] can be used to provide templates for documents, and [http://sharepointmaven.com/4-things-to-do-before-creating-a-workflow-in-sharepoint-and-office-365/ basic workflows] can automate certain tasks.

SPO can be accessed via almost any browser from almost any device and a SharePoint mobile app is available for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.

SPO is similar to any app you may have on your smartphone: it gets updated on a regular basis with bug fixes, feature updates, and major function rollouts. Some new features can be turned off or deferred by the [[tenant admin]], but many cannot.

## Integrations 
*Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote) are built in to SPO through [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/word-online-service-description.aspx Office Online]. Create new Office documents directly in a library or create new files in the desktop app and save or upload to SPO.
*SPO is similar to OneDrive for Business (OD). OD4B is built off SharePoint technology and each user receives a OD for hosting personal, draft, and ad hoc files before they need to be shared with teammates in SPO. SPO actually uses the OD sync client to sync SharePoint files to your hard drive.
*SPO Task Lists can be [http://icsh.pt/MPPtoSharePoint synced with Microsoft Project files], giving project team members access to the tasks, dates, and resources of an MPP file without risking its integrity. This minimizes the need for expensive Microsoft Project licenses and the seemingly ever-present and poorly formatted PDF Gantt chart for those users without licenses.

## Limitations
*SPO has [http://icsh.pt/SPFileTypeLimits file type and naming restrictions] you should be aware of.
*SPO has [http://icsh.pt/SPUseLimits file size and usage restrictions] you should be aware of.

## Comparison to SharePoint on-premises

## Additional functionality
Because SPO is regularly updated with smaller features rolled out as they're ready (as opposed to waiting for a major patch or update to a major version of SharePoint), SPO enjoys additional functions and features that versions of SharePoint on-prem do not have or won't gain until those features are rolled into an upgrade. Below is an incomplete list of features/functionality that SPO has that earlier versions of SharePoint on-prem do not.
*[[Modern document library]] experience
*[[Modern list]] experience
*[[Modern page]] experience

## Deprecated functionality 
SPO lacks some functionality that came with previous, on-prem versions of SharePoint. Below is an incomplete list.
*Text/SMS alerts are not supported from SPO even though the option still remains visible when setting an alert. The SharePoint [https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/12298992-add-support-for-sms-in-sharepoint-online indicates] this will never be included, though they mention push notifications may be coming.

## Security
Content in SPO is security-trimmed, meaning only those [http://icsh.pt/PermissionsInSP with permissions] can access any given content. Content can be shared with colleagues that are internal to your organization or [http://icsh.pt/ExternalSharing with external contacts], presuming the administrator has enabled external sharing.

SPO comes with numerous [https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wbaer/2017/03/13/security-and-compliance-in-sharepoint-online-and-onedrive-for-business/ security and compliance credentials], which system administrators generally review before going live with an SPO system.

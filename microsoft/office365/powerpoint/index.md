PowerPoint Online is a browser-based version of Microsoft PowerPoint,
the ubiquitous slideshow app you\'ve likely been using for years.
PowerPoint Online is a \"lite\" version of the full-fledged desktop app
and provides fast opening times for reading and editing .pptx and .ppt
files. PowerPoint Online is great for reading PowerPoint files, making
simple edits, and presenting your slides directly from almost any
browser on pretty much any device.

Most PowerPoint files will open directly in PowerPoint Online when using
SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, MS Teams, Yammer, and some
other Office 365 apps. Files open in reading mode. To edit the files,
simply click the \"Edit Presentation\" button and choose to edit the
file in PowerPoint Online (directly in the browser) or PowerPoint (the
desktop app). To present a file, click the \"Start Slideshow\" button.

Functionality in PowerPoint Online is generally limited to day-to-day
editing, text formatting, simple tables, simple animations, slide layout
changes, hyperlinks, and comments, though it provides excellent support
for [co-authoring](http://icsh.pt/CoAuthoring) (simultaneous editing by
multiple users). All changes made in PowerPoint Online are saved
automatically; there is no save button.

You\'ll want to avoid more complex tasks like some animations, editing
headers and footers, adding Excel charts, inserting shapes and charts,
and applying rich formatting (among others) in PowerPoint Online. Some
animations are simplified and not as rich if you present the file in
PowerPoint Online.

If PowerPoint Online doesn\'t provide the features you need to do the
job, simply click the \"Edit in PowerPoint\" button in the menu bar to
access the desktop version of the app and its more complex features.
Some versions of the desktop app save updates automatically, but some do
not. Be aware of how this feature works on your version.

OneNote Online is a browser-based version of OneNote, Microsoft's
commercial-grade note-taking app. OneNote Online is a \"lite\" version
of the full-fledged desktop app and provides fast opening times for
reading and editing .one notebook files. OneNote Online is great for
taking centralized notes organized by pages, sections, and books, like
how physical notebooks work.

Most OneNote files will open directly in OneNote Online when using
SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, MS Teams, Yammer, Outlook, and
some other Office 365 apps. Files open in reading mode. To edit the
files, simply click the \"Edit Notebook\" button and choose to edit the
file in OneNote Online (directly in the browser) or OneNote (the desktop
app).

Functionality in OneNote Online is generally limited to day-to-day
note-taking, text formatting, simple tables, hyperlinks, page and
section changes, though it provides excellent support for
[co-authoring](http://icsh.pt/CoAuthoring) (simultaneous editing by
multiple users). All changes made in OneNote Online are saved
automatically; there is no save button.

You\'ll want to avoid more complex tasks like ink, shapes, audio and
video recording, and inserting symbols (among others) in OneNote Online.

If OneNote Online doesn\'t provide the features you need to do the job,
simply click the \"Edit in OneNote\" button in the menu bar to access
the desktop version of the app and its more complex features.

Yammer is a private, secure social network for your organization that will allow people to collaborate securely across departments and geographies. Itâ€™s designed to inspire company-wide knowledge exchange and to increase team efficiency. Only people with a verified company email address can join your company network.

## Newsfeed or Yammer?
Office 365 includes two options for enterprise social features: Yammer and the SharePoint Newsfeed. If you pick Yammer to be your social experience, follow the [Enterprise Activation process](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enterprise-Activation-process-4f924c74-87d2-49d0-a4f6-cba3ce2b0e7c) to activate Yammer. After activation, a Yammer tile appears on the Office 365 portal page and the app launcher, making it easy for Office 365 users to reach Yammer. Also, if your network is eligible, users can sign-in to Yammer using their Office 365 account.

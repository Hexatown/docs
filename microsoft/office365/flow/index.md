Microsoft Flow is a user-friendly, [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) task automation tool. Flow provides you the ability to pre-program tasks that are repetitive, standardized, time-consuming, or straight-up boring. Flow is reasonably easy for an everyday worker with no programming or technical experience to use to their advantage.

Flow is especially good for approval workflows, integrating multiple apps and services, and automating time-consuming and monotonous tasks. Flow can be used for something as simple as routing a document for approval by your manager or as complex as onboarding a new employee at your organization. Flows can be personal (only for you) or shared (made available for everyone in a department or company).

Some of Flowâ€™s strongest attributes include its [template](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/) store (because why reinvent the wheel?), [connectors](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/) that can speak to both Office 365 and non-Microsoft services (e.g., Google Apps, DropBox, Salesforce, DocuSign, Twitter), and its ease of use. You can even use Flow to [program bots](https://blog.getbizzy.io/introducing-bizzy-templates-b191b38d2370) in Microsoft Teams, for free, all without coding.

Flow has opened up work automation to the masses in a way few other apps have in the past, for its price. Flow is the [successor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/flow/frequently-asked-questions) of SharePoint Designer workflows, though it is not meant to be a replacement.

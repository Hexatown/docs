Create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to get notifications, synchronize files, collect data, and more

## Multistep flows
Turn repetitive tasks into multistep workflows. For example, with a few clicks capture tweets and add them as leads in Dynamics 365, subscribers in Mailchimp, and more...

## Approve requests
Create, use, and share automated approval workflows to quickly respond to and process requests, from time off and travel plans to documents and sales opportunities.

## Adding conditions
Make decisions in your workflow, like running an action only when certain conditions are met.

## Using on-premises data
Flow lets you securely connect to on-premises data and cloud based services, so you can make the most of the data you already have.

## Working securely 
Prevent sensitive data from leaving your company using built-in or customized data loss prevention policies.

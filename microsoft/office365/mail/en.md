Outlook Mail is the webmail component of Outlook on the web. It has an interface similar to the mail part of Outlook Web App before it. The default view is a three column view with folders and groups on the left, email in the center, and on the right the selected message. As of the 2015 Outlook on the web update, Microsoft introduced the ability to pin messages, sweep, archive, undo, and richer image editing features. [8] Outlook Mail added the ability to connect to other services such as GitHub and Twitter through Office 365 Connectors. Actionable Messages in emails allows a user to complete a task from within the email, such as retweeting a Tweet on Twitter or setting a meeting date on a calendar.

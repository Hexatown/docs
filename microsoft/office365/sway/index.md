Sway is a publishing tool built to make the most of modern digital design practices. Sway is best used to create multimedia-heavy presentations, reports, stories, and newsletters viewed in a web browser or on a mobile device.

Sways make use of functionality that other similar tools (e.g., PowerPoint) cannot: for example, Sway integrates scrolling—both horizontal and vertical—as a strong aspect of design of Sways since scrolling has become very easy on computers (two-finger scrolling and mice with built-in crollers) and mobile devices (a finger as a stylus can scroll anywhere).

Similar to other Office apps, Sway provides multiple template and the ability to start a Sway from scratch. Sways are stored on Sway.com; they are not saved in SharePoint nor OneDrive and the files cannot be saved or moved out of Sway.com.

Sway is similar to PowerPoint in the use case of building presentations. But, Sway excels at producing content that does not require a presenter, whereas PowerPoint slide decks usually require someone to speak to the content. Sway is also best used for displaying dynamic online content like social media posts.

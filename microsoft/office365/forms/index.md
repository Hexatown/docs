Microsoft Forms is a simple survey, poll, and quiz tool. MS Forms gives
everyday workers the ability to create reasonably complex forms for
garnering feedback, getting sign ups, submitting simple requests, and
completing questionnaires.

Forms can be shared with internal and external users. External users
need not sign in and all external submissions are listed as anonymous
(unless you request their contact information within your questions).
External users can even be invited to help collaborate on questions and
can review the results.

Forms results are simple and display as lists of text, pie charts (for
radio questions), or column charts (for check box questions). Complete
results can also be opened and downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet.

Though technically a "forms" application, MS Forms does not support
complex form building and is not a replacement for SharePoint Designer,
InfoPath, or PowerApps functionality.

If you'd like to see what a Microsoft Form looks like in the real world,

using Microsoft Forms.

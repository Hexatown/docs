Bookings is a customer-facing scheduling and appointment tool meant to promote self-service, flexibility, and 24/7 availability to create, change, or cancel reservations between your customers and your organization. Complete with landing page support and automated reminders, Bookings aims to improve customer interact and decrease no-shows. 

Through Bookings, customers can reserve a service type, date/time, and individual employee; get a confirmation email and calendar invitation; and reschedule or cancel if necessary. If a customer books over the phone, an employee can submit the information into Bookings and the app will send all confirmations and reminders to the customer. Bookings provides basic payment processing support as well.

Unlock creativity with personalized search. Discover people & content in the context of your work.


## View content relevant to you
Wherever you are working, search is personalized. Bringing you content from across Office 365—from OneDrive, SharePoint, Exchange and more. Powered by the Microsoft Graph, search in any application brings you information based on what you’re working on, who you’re working with; always maintaining established permissions.

## Search meets you wherever you are
From SharePoint to Delve, from Office apps to Bing for your business, harness the collective knowledge of your organization in every experience. Using the intelligence of the Microsoft Graph, relevant content will surface to keep you up to date and leverage the work of others. 

## Share your expertise and experience
Build a rich, personal profile to work out loud across your organization. Share the projects you have been involved with, the skills you have, interests you want to develop and what others can ask you about. Integration with LinkedIn will help you showcase your past achievements.

## Learn more about other people—their documents and ideas
With a People card that goes across Office 365, it’s easy to help you find out more about what other people are working on, who they work with and their expertise. Quick actions let you connect with them via email, chat or call.
